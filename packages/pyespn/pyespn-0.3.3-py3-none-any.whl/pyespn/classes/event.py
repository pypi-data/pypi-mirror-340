        odds (list[GameOdds]): List of betting odds (if available).
        drives (list[Drive] or None): A list of `Drive` instances for football games.
        plays (list[Play] or None): A list of `Play` instances for basketball games.

    Methods:
        load_betting_odds():
            Fetches and parses multi-page betting odds data.

        load_play_by_play():
            Routes to appropriate play-by-play loader depending on sport type.

        _load_competition_data():
            Loads metadata about the specific competition instance.

        _load_teams():
            Populates home_team and away_team attributes from competitors JSON.
