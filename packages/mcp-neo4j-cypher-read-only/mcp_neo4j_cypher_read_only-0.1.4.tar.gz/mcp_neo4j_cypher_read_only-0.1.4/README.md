# ��⁉️ Neo4j MCP Server Read-Only

## 🌟 Overview

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation that provides read-only database interaction and allows graph exploration capabilities through Neo4j. This server enables running Cypher graph queries, analyzing complex domain data, and automatically generating business insights that can be enhanced with Claude's analysis.

## 🧩 Components

### 🛠️ Tools

The server offers these core tools:

#### 📊 Query Tools
- `read-neo4j-cypher`
   - Execute Cypher read queries to read data from the database
   - Input: 
     - `query` (string): The Cypher query to execute
   - Returns: Query results as array of objects

#### 🕸️ Schema Tools
- `get-neo4j-schema`
   - Get a list of all nodes types in the graph database, their attributes with name, type and relationships to other node types
   - No input required
   - Returns: List of node label with two dictionaries one for attributes and one for relationships

## 🔧 Usage with Claude Desktop

### 💾 Released Package

Can be found on PyPi https://pypi.org/project/mcp-neo4j-cypher-read-only/

Add the server to your `claude_desktop_config.json` with configuration of:

* db-url
* username
* password


Alternatively, you can set environment variables:

```json
"mcpServers": {
  "neo4j-aura": {
    "command": "uvx",
    "args": [ "mcp-neo4j-cypher-read-only==0.1.3" ],
    "env": {
      "NEO4J_URL": "bolt://localhost:7687",
      "NEO4J_USERNAME": "neo4j",
      "NEO4J_PASSWORD": "<your-password>"
    }
  }
}
```

Here is an example connection for the movie database with Movie, Person (Actor, Director), Genre, User and ratings:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "movies-neo4j": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-neo4j-cypher-read-only==0.1.3"],
          "env": {
      "NEO4J_URL": "neo4j+s://demo.neo4jlabs.com",
      "NEO4J_USERNAME": "recommendations",
      "NEO4J_PASSWORD": "recommendations"
    }
    }   
  }
}
```

Syntax with `--db-url`, `--username` and `--password` was supported but will be removed in future versions:

  "neo4j": {
    "command": "uvx",
    "args": [
      "mcp-neo4j-cypher-read-only==0.1.3",
      "--db-url",
      "bolt://localhost",
      "--username",
      "neo4j",
      "--password",
      "<your-password>"
    ]
  }
}
```

Here is an example connection for the movie database with Movie, Person (Actor, Director), Genre, User and ratings:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "movies-neo4j": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-neo4j-cypher-read-only==0.1.3", 
      "--db-url", "neo4j+s://demo.neo4jlabs.com", 
      "--user", "recommendations", 
      "--password", "recommendations"]
    }   
  }
}
```

    "command": "docker",
    "args": [
      "run",
      "--rm",
      "-e", "NEO4J_URL=bolt://host.docker.internal:7687",
      "-e", "NEO4J_USERNAME=neo4j",
      "-e", "NEO4J_PASSWORD=<your-password>",
      "mcp/neo4j-cypher-read-only:0.1.3"
    ]
  }
