# Starfield Saver

A utility to automatically quicksave in Starfield on a specified interval, as well as back them up by duplicating them to regular saves so they aren't overwritten by subsequent quicksaves. Also supports autosaves.

- `prune_saves_older_than`: Number of days before pruning saves to one per day (0 to keep all).
- `dry_run`: Whether to perform a dry run of save cleanup.
- `enable_sounds`: Whether to play sounds on events.
