# Prime Bits

Prime Bits is a project focused on exploring and working with prime numbers in the context of computer science and programming.

## Features

- Efficient algorithms for prime number generation.
- Utilities for prime number validation.
- Tools for analyzing prime-related patterns.

## How to install

```bash
python3 -m pip install prime-bits
```

## How to use
```python
from prime_bits import get_prime

get_prime(1024) # 1024 -> number of bits in the number.
```

## Functions

- `get_prime` - You can see what that function does above. ðŸ‘†

In the current version `v1.0.4` I have added 2 additional functions.

- `get_safe_prime` - This function get's a safe prime number. (This uses multi-processing)
- `is_prime` - This function checks if the number given is a prime. (This uses the Miller-Rabin primality test)

  
```python
from prime_bits import get_safe_prime, is_prime


get_safe_prime(1024) # This will act the exact same way as the `get_prime` function. But it will ensure that the prime number given is a safe prime.

is_prime(some_prime_number) # This will checks using the Miller-Rabin primality test, is this number a prime. If so it will return True, False otherwise.
```
