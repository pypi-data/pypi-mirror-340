A local LLM-powered pair programming assistant using function calling capabilities with Ollama. Code Ally helps you with coding tasks through natural language, providing tools for file operations, code searching, and executing shell commands - all while keeping your code and data local.

## 🚀 Features

-   **Interactive Conversation:** Engage with an LLM (named "Ally") to solve coding tasks collaboratively
-   **Comprehensive Tool Suite:**
    -   Read, write, and edit files with precise control
    -   Find files using glob patterns (similar to `find`)
    -   Search file contents with regex (similar to `grep`)
    -   Execute shell commands safely with security checks
-   **Safety-First Design:**
    -   User confirmation prompts for potentially destructive operations
    -   Session-based or path-specific permissions
    -   Command filtering to prevent dangerous operations
-   **Excellent Developer Experience:**
    -   Rich terminal UI with color-coded feedback and clear formatting
    -   Function-calling interface with Ollama LLMs
    -   Flexible configuration via command line, slash commands, or config file
-   **Multi-Step Planning:**
    -   Ability to plan and execute multi-step tasks interactively
-   **Enhanced Context Awareness:**
    -   Truncated directory tree generation for better project understanding
    -   Configurable depth and file limits to conserve context window
    -   Automatic exclusion of common patterns like node_modules, .git, etc.

## 📋 Prerequisites

-   **Python 3.8+** (Tested with 3.8-3.11, supports 3.13)
-   **[Ollama](https://ollama.com)** running locally with function-calling capable models:
    -   **Recommended models:** qwen2.5-coder:14b or newer models that support function calling
    -   Make sure Ollama is running before starting Code Ally
    -   Code Ally will automatically check if Ollama is configured properly and provide instructions if needed

## 🔧 Installation

### Model Compatibility

**Important**: Code Ally currently works only with models that support Ollama's native "tools" API field. This includes:

-   ✅ Qwen models (qwen2:7b, qwen2:4b, qwen2-coder:14b, etc.)

Attempting to use incompatible models will result in a 400 Bad Request error from the Ollama API. At this point, I recommend a trial-and-error approach to find a compatible model.

For the current list of likely-compatible models, check [Ollama's model library](https://ollama.com/search?c=tools).

### From PyPI (Recommended)

```bash
# Create a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install from PyPI
pip install code_ally

# Install the required Ollama model
ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:14b
```

### Development Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/benhmoore/CodeAlly.git
cd code_ally

# Create a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install in development mode with development dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# OR, if you're on macOS with Homebrew Python and encounter the externally-managed-environment error:
pip install -e ".[dev]" --break-system-packages

# Install the required Ollama model
ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:14b
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

Code Ally uses a layered configuration approach:

1. **Command line arguments** (highest precedence)
2. **User config file** located at `~/.config/ally/config.json`
3. **Default values**

### Managing Configuration

```bash
# View your current configuration
ally --config-show

# Save current settings as defaults
ally --model qwen2.5-coder:14b --temperature 0.8 --config

# Reset to default configuration
ally --config-reset
```

### In-Session Configuration

You can view and modify configuration during a session using the `/config` command:

```
# View all current settings
/config

# Modify a setting (using key=value format)
/config temperature=0.8
/config auto_confirm=true
```

### Configuration File Structure

The configuration file is a JSON file with the following structure:

```json
{
    "model": "qwen2.5-coder:14b",
    "endpoint": "http://localhost:11434",
    "context_size": 12000,
    "temperature": 0.7,
    "max_tokens": 5000,
    "bash_timeout": 30,
    "auto_confirm": false,
    "check_context_msg": true,
    "parallel_tools": true,
    "qwen_template": "qwen2.5_function_calling",
    "dump_dir": "ally",
    "auto_dump": false,
    "theme": "default",
    "compact_threshold": 95,
    "show_token_usage": true,

    "dir_tree_enable": true, // Enable directory tree in context
    "dir_tree_max_depth": 3, // Maximum directory depth to traverse
    "dir_tree_max_files": 100 // Maximum files to show in tree
}
```

## 🖥️ Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Start Code Ally with default settings
ally

# Display help information about available commands
ally --help
```

### Advanced Options

```bash
# Use a specific model
ally --model qwen2.5-coder:14b

# Connect to a different Ollama endpoint
ally --endpoint http://localhost:11434

# Adjust generation parameters
ally --temperature 0.8 --context-size 8192 --max-tokens 2000

# Skip all confirmation prompts (use with caution!)
ally --yes-to-all
```

## 🔒 Security Considerations

-   Code Ally requires confirmation for potentially destructive operations
-   The `bash` tool filters dangerous commands and requires explicit user confirmation
-   Use `--yes-to-all` with caution as it bypasses confirmation prompts
-   All operations remain local to your machine
-   You can view and manage tool permissions with the `/trust` command

```

The project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration, which automatically runs tests and linting on pull requests.

### Versioning and Releasing

We use [bump2version](https://github.com/c4urself/bump2version) for version management:

```bash
# Install bump2version if needed
pip install bump2version

# Release a new patch version (e.g., 0.4.2 -> 0.4.3)
bump2version patch

# Release a new minor version (e.g., 0.4.2 -> 0.5.0)
bump2version minor

# Release a new major version (e.g., 0.4.2 -> 1.0.0)
bump2version major
```

When a new tag is pushed to GitHub, our CI/CD pipeline automatically builds and publishes the package to PyPI.
