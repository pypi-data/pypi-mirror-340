class DatabaseConnectionsPool(Database):
    """
    Represents a pool of connections to a database, for using in high-load multithreading environments. As a child of
    Database object it can be used everywhere where Database can.
    The main difference is a number of created connections. By default, the minimum number is equal to CPU cores count
    in the system and cannot be less than 2.

    During work, if no more non-busy connections to use, then new connection will be created until its number not
    reaches maximum for the pool
