           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

## What is Superduper?

Superduper is a Python based framework for building **end-2-end AI-data workflows and applications** on your own data, integrating with major databases. It supports the latest technologies and techniques, including LLMs, vector-search, RAG, multimodality as well as classical AI and ML paradigms.

Developers may leverage Superduper by building **compositional and declarative objects** which out-source the details of deployment, orchestration and versioning, and more to the Superduper engine. This allows developers to completely avoid implementing MLOps, ETL pipelines, model deployment, data migration and synchronization.

Using Superduper is simply "**CAPE**": **Connect** to your data, **apply** arbitrary AI to that data, **package** and reuse the application on arbitrary data, and **execute** AI-database queries and predictions on the resulting AI outputs and data.

- **Connect**
- **Apply**
- **Package**
- **Execute**

<img src="https://github.com/superduper-io/superduper/blob/main/img/apply.gif" alt="Alt text for the image" style="width: 100%;">

**Connect**

```python
db = superduper('mongodb|postgres|mysql|sqlite|duckdb|snowflake://<your-db-uri>')
```

**Apply**

```python
listener = MyLLM('self_hosted_llm', architecture='llama-3.2', postprocess=my_postprocess).to_listener('documents', key='txt')
db.apply(listener)
```

**Package**

```python
application = Application('my-analysis-app', components=[listener, vector_index])
template = Template('my-analysis', component=app, substitutions={'documents': 'table'})
template.export('my-analysis')
```

**Execute**

```python
query = db['documents'].like({'txt', 'Tell me about Superduper'}, vector_index='my-index').select()
query.execute()
```

Superduper may be run anywhere; you can also [contact us](https://superduper.io/contact) to learn more about the enterprise platform for bringing your Superduper workflows to production at scale. 

## What does Superduper support?

Superduper is flexible enough to support a huge range of AI techniques and paradigms. We have a range of pre-built functionality in the `plugins` and `templates` directories. In particular, Superduper excels when AI and data need to interact in a continuous and tightly integrated fashion. Here are some illustrative examples, which you may try out from our templates:

- Semantic multimodal vector search ([images](https://github.com/superduper-io/superduper/tree/main/templates/multimodal_image_search), [text](https://github.com/superduper-io/superduper/tree/main/templates/text_vector_search), [video](https://github.com/superduper-io/superduper/tree/main/templates/multimodal_video_search))
- [Retrieval augmented generation](https://github.com/superduper-io/superduper/tree/main/templates/retrieval_augmented_generation) with specialized requirements (data fetching involves semantic search as well as business rules and pre-processing)
- [LLM finetuning on database hosted data](https://github.com/superduper-io/superduper/tree/main/templates/llm_finetuning)
- [Transfer learning using multimodal data](https://github.com/superduper-io/superduper/tree/main/templates/transfer_learning)

We're looking to connect with enthusiastic developers to contribute to the repertoire of amazing pre-built templates and workflows available in Superduper open-source. Please join the discussion, by contributing issues and pull requests!

## Core features

- Create a Superduper data-AI connection/ datalayer consisting of your own
  - databackend (database/ datalake/ datawarehouse)
  - metadata store (same or other as databackend)
  - artifact store (to store big objects)
  - compute implementation
- Build complex units of functionality (`Component`) using a declarative programming model, which integrate closely with data in your databackend, using a simple set of primitives and base classes.
- Build larger units of functionality wrapping several interrelated `Component` instances into an AI-data `Application`
- Reuse battle-tested `Component`, `Model` and `Application` instances using `Template`, giving developers an easy point to start with difficult AI implementations
- A transparent, human-readable, web-friendly and highly portable serialization protocol, "Superduper-protocol", to communicate results of experimentation, make `Application` lineage and versioning easy to follow, and create an elegant segway from the AI world to the databasing/ typed-data worlds.
- Execute queries using a combination of outputs of `Model` instances as well as primary databackend data, to enable the latest generation of AI-data applications, including all flavours of vector-search, RAG, and much, much more.

## Key benefits

**Massive flexibility**

Combine any Python based AI model, API from the ecosystem with the most established, battle tested databases and warehouses;  Snowflake, MongoDB, Postgres, MySQL, SQL Server, SQLite, BigQuery, and Clickhouse are all supported.

**Seamless integration avoiding MLOps**

Remove the need to implement MLOps, using the declarative and compositional Superduper components, which specify the end state that the models and data should reach.

**Promote code reusability and portability**

Package components as templates, exposing the key parameters required to reuse and communicate AI applications in your community and organization.

**Cost savings**

Implement vector search and embedding generation without requiring a dedicated vector database. Effortlessly toggle between self hosted models and API hosted models, without major code changes.

**Move to production without any additional effort**

Superduper's REST API, allows installed models to be served without additional development work. For enterprise grade scalability, fail safes, security and logging, applications and workflows created with Superduper, may be deployed in one click on [Superduper enterprise](https://superduper.io/contact).


## What's new in the `main` branch?

We are working on an upcoming release of `0.5.0`. In this release we will have:

### A graceful update schema to update already applied components

This means that changing a prompt or parameter deep in your `Component` won't mean 
starting all components from scratch. This also lays the groundwork for rollbacks 
and version pins.

### A smart form builder leveraging the `Template` class

This will allow developers to expose their applications as no-code interfaces.

### Serialization based on Python native type annotations

```python
from superduper import typing as t

class MyPDF:
    path: t.File
    my_func: t.Blob
    my_other_func: t.Pickle
```

## Getting started

**Installation**:

```bash
pip install superduper-framework
```

**View** available pre-built templates:

```bash
superduper ls
```

**Connect** and **apply** a pre-built template:

(***Note:*** *the pre-built templates are only supported by Python 3.10; you may use all of the other features in Python 3.11+.*)

```bash
# e.g. 'mongodb://localhost:27017/test_db'
SUPERDUPER_DATA_BACKEND=<your-db-uri> superduper apply simple_rag
```

**Execute** a query or prediction on the results:

```python
from superduper import superduper
db = superduper('<your-db-uri>')  # e.g. 'mongodb://localhost:27017/test_db'
db['rag'].predict('Tell me about superduper')
```

**View** and **monitor** everything in the Superduper interface. From the command line:

```bash
superduper start
```

***After doing this you are ready to build your own components, applications and templates!***

**Get started** by copying an existing template, to your own development environment:

```bash
superduper bootstrap <template_name> --destination templates/my-template
```

**Edit** the `build.ipynb` notebook, to build your own functionality.
