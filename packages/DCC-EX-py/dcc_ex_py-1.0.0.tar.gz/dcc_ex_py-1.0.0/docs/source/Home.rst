DCC-EX_py is a Python package for controlling your model train layout with DCC-EX's native command protocol.

[DCC-EX](https://dcc-ex.com/#gsc.tab=0) is an Arduino powered DIY tool for running DCC model trains on a layout.
This package wraps the protocol described in the [DCC-EX Native Commands Summary Reference](https://dcc-ex.com/reference/software/command-summary-consolidated.html) to be easy to use from python code.

Take a look at these examples, please be aware that the crossing signal is being controlled by EX-RAIL automation on the command station instead of by python code.
