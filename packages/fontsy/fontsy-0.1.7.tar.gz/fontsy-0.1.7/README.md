# Fontsy - ASCII Art Font Explorer

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A fun interactive ASCII art generator for your terminal that lets you explore, preview, and export text in hundreds of different font styles. Fontsy was a small exercise in so called "vibe coding" with our own agent framework called Flock. 

**Almost everything was written by Flock.**
