# Fontsy - ASCII Art Font Explorer

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A powerful interactive ASCII art generator for your terminal that lets you explore, preview, and export text in hundreds of different font styles. Fonty was a small exercise in so called "vibe coding". **Not a single line of code in this project was written by a human.** 

> This is a workshop project for our dev productivity hands-on workshop!


## ✨ Features

- Explore hundreds of ASCII art fonts interactively
- Preview text in different font categories: 3D, block, banner, bubble, digital, script, and more
- Two display modes: grid (compact) and list (detailed)
- Mark fonts as favorites for quick access
- Export creations to HTML, markdown, or plain text
- Showcase mode to view your text in all available fonts
- Clipboard integration for quick copying
- Rich, colorful terminal interface

## 🚀 Quick Start

The easiest way to use Fontsy is with [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv):

```bash
# Run without installing
uvx fontsy
```

## 📋 Usage

Once running, Fontsy operates through a simple command interface:

- Type your **text** and press Enter to see it in different fonts
- Press **Enter** with empty input to see new fonts for the same text
- Type a **font category** to filter fonts (standard, small, medium, large, xlarge, ascii_only, 3d, etc.)
- Type **grid** or **list** to change display mode
- Type **showcase** to see your text in ALL fonts
- Type a **number** (e.g., '3') to favorite the font with that number
- Type **clipboard number** (e.g., 'clipboard 5') to copy a font to clipboard
- Type **favorite font_name** to mark a specific font as favorite
- Type **favorites** to see only your favorite fonts
- Type **export html/text/md** to save the current view
- Type **help** for a full list of commands
- Type **quit** to exit

## 🏗️ Architecture

Fontsy follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Core Components**: Manage application state, fonts, and user preferences
- **UI Components**: Handle display modes, user interface, and visual presentation
- **Exporters**: Handle exporting to different file formats
- **Utils**: Contain helper functions and utilities
