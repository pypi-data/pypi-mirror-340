## Usage

### Running the service

You can run the service in several ways:

#### Install in Claude Desktop

To install this service and interact with it immediately in Claude Desktop:

```bash
fastmcp install src/seo_mcp/server.py
```

#### Use MCP Inspector for testing

For development and testing:

```bash
fastmcp dev src/seo_mcp/server.py
```

#### Install in Cursor IDE

In the Cursor settings, switch to the MCP tab, click the `+ Add new global MCP service` button, and then input the following content:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "SEO MCP": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["--python 3.10", "seo-mcp"],
      "env": {

### API Reference

The service exposes the following MCP tools:

#### `get_backlinks_list(domain: str)`

Retrieve the backlink list for a specified domain.

**Parameters:**

- `domain` (string): The domain to query (e.g. "example.com")

**Returns:**

A list of backlink objects, each containing:

- `anchor`：The anchor text of the backlink
- `domainRating`：The domain rating (0-100)
- `title`：The title of the linked page
- `urlFrom`：The URL of the page containing the backlink
- `urlTo`：The URL of the page being linked to
- `edu`：A boolean value indicating whether the backlink is from an educational website
- `gov`：A boolean value indicating whether the backlink is from a government website

**Example Response:**

```json
[
  {
    "anchor": "Example link",
    "domainRating": 76,
    "title": "Useful resource",
    "urlFrom": "https://referringsite.com/resources",
    "urlTo": "https://example.com/page",
    "edu": false,
    "gov": false
  },
  ...
]
```

#### `keyword_generator(keyword: str, country: str = "us", search_engine: str = "Google")`

Get creative and SEO suggestions for a specified keyword.

**Parameters:**

- `keyword` (string): The keyword to query
- `country` (string): The country code (e.g. "us")
- `search_engine` (string): The search engine (e.g. "Google")

**Returns:**

- A list of keyword ideas, containing two types:

  - `keyword ideas`：Regular keyword suggestions, containing keyword, country, difficulty, volume, and update time
  - `question ideas`：Question-based keyword suggestions, with the same format

  Each keyword object contains:

  - `keyword`：The keyword text
  - `country`：The country code
  - `difficulty`：The difficulty rating (Easy, Medium, Hard, or Unknown)
  - `volume`：The search volume level (e.g. MoreThanOneHundred, MoreThanOneThousand)
  - `updatedAt`：The data update time

## Development

For development purposes, you can clone the repository and install the development dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cnych/seo-mcp.git
cd seo-mcp
uv sync  # or use pip install -e .
```

## How it works

1. The service first attempts to retrieve the cached signature of the domain
2. If no valid cache exists, it will:
   - Use CapSolver to solve the Cloudflare Turnstile captcha
   - Retrieve the signature and expiration date from Ahrefs
   - Cache this information for future use
3. Use the signature to retrieve SEO data
4. Process and return simplified SEO information

## Troubleshooting

- **CapSolver API key error**：Ensure the `CAPSOLVER_API_KEY` environment variable is correctly set
- **Rate limiting**：If you encounter rate limiting, try reducing the frequency of using the service
- **No results**：Some domains may have no backlinks or not indexed by Ahrefs
- **Issues**：If you encounter issues with SEO MCP, please refer to the [SEO MCP GitHub repository](https://github.com/cnych/seo-mcp) for troubleshooting guides
