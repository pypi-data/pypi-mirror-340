class AcceleratorType(Enum):
    """
    Enumeration of accelerator types denoting a subset of the accelerators recognized
    by PyTorch Lightning's AcceleratorRegistry.

    See also:
    - https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/2.1.4/extensions/accelerator.html
    - https://github.com/Lightning-AI/pytorch-lightning/blob/2.1.4/src/lightning/pytorch/trainer/connectors/accelerator_connector.py#L209-L217

    This enumeration supports validation of the selection of accelerator types for
    computations, providing a straightforward way to specify the desired
    computation device. It accounts for a subset of the available accelerators
    as reported by `AcceleratorRegistry.available_accelerators()` from PyTorch
    Lightning, specifically targeting 'cpu' and 'cuda' accelerators, while also
    offering an 'auto' option for automatic selection.

    It would be preferable to restrict this to subclasses of
    `lightning.pytorch.accelerators.Accelerator`, but there is no such instance
    that supporting the "auto" option, which lightning only references via a
    string.
    https://github.com/Lightning-AI/pytorch-lightning/blob/2.1.4/src/lightning/pytorch/accelerators/accelerator.py.

    Members:
    - AUTO: Represents an automatic choice of accelerator based on the system's
            availability and configuration. This option is intended to provide
            flexibility, allowing PyTorch Lightning to automatically select the
            most appropriate accelerator: usually CPU vs CUDA.
    - CPU: Specifies the use of the CPU for computations. This is a universal
           option, available on all systems.
           See https://github.com/Lightning-AI/pytorch-lightning/blob/2.1.4/src/lightning/pytorch/accelerators/cpu.py.
    - CUDA: Specifies the use of NVIDIA CUDA-enabled GPUs for computations. This
            option should be selected when intending to leverage GPU acceleration,
            assuming CUDA-compatible hardware is available.
            See https://github.com/Lightning-AI/pytorch-lightning/blob/2.1.4/src/lightning/pytorch/accelerators/cuda.py.

    This enumeration does not cover all the accelerators available in
    PyTorch Lightning, such as 'tpu' and 'mps'. It reflects options that are
    tested with this library.
