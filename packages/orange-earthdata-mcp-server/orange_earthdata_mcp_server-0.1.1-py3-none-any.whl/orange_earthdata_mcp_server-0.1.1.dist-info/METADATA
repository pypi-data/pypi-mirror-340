# ü™ê ‚ú® Earthdata MCP Server

[![Github Actions Status](https://github.com/datalayer/earthdata-mcp-server/workflows/Build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/datalayer/earthdata-mcp-server/actions/workflows/build.yml)
[![PyPI - Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/earthdata-mcp-server)](https://pypi.org/project/earthdata-mcp-server)

Earthdata MCP Server is a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) (MCP) server implementation that provides tools to interact with [NASA Earth Data](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/). It enables efficient dataset discovery and retrieval for Geospatial analysis.

The following demo uses this MCP server to search for datasets and data granules on NASA Earthdata, the [jupyter-earth-mcp-server](https://github.com/datalayer/jupyter-earth-mcp-server) to download the data in Jupyter and the [jupyter-mcp-server](https://github.com/datalayer/jupyter-mcp-server) to run further analysis.

## Use with Claude Desktop

To use this with Claude Desktop, add the following to your `claude_desktop_config.json`.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "earthdata": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "datalayer/earthdata-mcp-server:latest"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

If you are using Linux, start Claude with the following command.

```bash
make claude-linux
```

## Tools

The server offers 2 tools.

### `search_earth_datasets`

- Search for datasets on NASA Earthdata.
- Input:
  - search_keywords (str): Keywords to search for in the dataset titles.
  - count (int): Number of datasets to return.
  - temporal (tuple): (Optional) Temporal range in the format (date_from, date_to).
  - bounding_box (tuple): (Optional) Bounding box in the format (lower_left_lon, lower_left_lat, upper_right_lon, upper_right_lat).
- Returns: List of dataset abstracts.

### `search_earth_datagranules`

- Search for data granules on NASA Earthdata.
- Input:
  - short_name (str): Short name of the dataset.
  - count (int): Number of data granules to return.
  - temporal (tuple): (Optional) Temporal range in the format (date_from, date_to).
  - bounding_box (tuple): (Optional) Bounding box in the format (lower_left_lon, lower_left_lat, upper_right_lon, upper_right_lat).
- Returns: List of data granules.
