"""
Base optimization class.

`atooms` provides a generic optimization interface that abstracts out
most of the common parts of particle-based optimizations.

The actual optimization code is wrapped by a simulation "backend" that
exposes a minimal but coherent interface.

`Optimization` uses callbacks to analyze and process optimization data
on the fly. The interval in steps at which callbacks are executed is
controlled by a `Scheduler` instance.
