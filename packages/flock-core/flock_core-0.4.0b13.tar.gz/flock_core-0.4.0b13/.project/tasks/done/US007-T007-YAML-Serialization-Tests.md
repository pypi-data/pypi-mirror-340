# Implement YAML Serialization Test Suite

## Summary

Create a comprehensive test suite for the YAML serialization functionality following test-driven development principles.

## Description

This task involves creating a robust test suite for the YAML serialization feature before the actual implementation begins. Following a test-driven development approach, these tests will define the expected behavior of the YAML serialization system and guide the implementation process. The tests will cover all aspects of YAML serialization, from basic serializable objects to complex agent systems.

## User Story

[US007-YAML-Serialization](.project/userstories/US007-YAML-Serialization.md)

## Technical Requirements

1. Create a comprehensive test suite for the Serializable base class YAML methods
2. Implement tests for FlockAgent YAML serialization
3. Create tests for Flock system YAML serialization
4. Implement tests for the callable reference system
5. Ensure all edge cases and error conditions are covered
6. Follow the project's testing conventions and patterns
7. Organize tests logically to match the implementation structure

## Test Requirements

The test suite should be organized into the following test categories:

1. **Serializable Base Tests**:
   - Tests for basic `to_yaml()` and `from_yaml()` methods
   - Tests for file operations (`to_yaml_file()` and `from_yaml_file()`)
   - Tests for various data types (string, int, bool, list, dict, nested structures)
   - Tests for error handling and edge cases

2. **FlockAgent YAML Tests**:
   - Tests for basic agent properties (name, description, model)
   - Tests for input/output field serialization
   - Tests for agent with evaluators, modules, and routers
   - Tests for agent with tools and tool references

3. **Flock System YAML Tests**:
   - Tests for Flock with single and multiple agents
   - Tests for system settings and configurations
   - Tests for agent relationships and handoffs
   - Tests for context and registry serialization

4. **Callable Reference Tests**:
   - Tests for registry-based callable references
   - Tests for import-based callable references
   - Tests for pickle fallback for complex callables
   - Tests for reference resolution and invocation

5. **Integration Tests**:
   - End-to-end tests for saving and loading agents
   - Tests for running agents after deserialization
   - Tests for manual YAML editing and loading
   - Tests for format conversion (JSON to YAML and back)

6. **Performance Tests**:
   - Tests for serialization speed with various complexity levels
   - Comparison tests with JSON serialization

The tests should be fully documented and include appropriate assertions to verify the expected behavior. Test fixtures should be used to provide reusable test data and reduce duplication.

## Implementation Plan

1. Create test files corresponding to each component:
   - `test_serializable_yaml.py`
   - `test_flockagent_yaml.py`
   - `test_flock_yaml.py`
   - `test_callable_reference.py`
   - `test_yaml_integration.py`
2. Implement mock classes and fixtures for testing
3. Implement test cases for each component
4. Add edge case and error condition tests
5. Create integration tests across components
6. Document all tests with clear descriptions

## Definition of Done

1. All specified test categories are implemented
2. Tests clearly define the expected behavior of the YAML serialization feature
3. Tests cover all major functionalities and edge cases
4. Test fixtures are created for reusable test data
5. Tests follow project conventions and best practices
6. All tests initially fail (as the implementation doesn't exist yet)
7. Test suite is reviewed and approved

## Dependencies

None (this is the first task that should be completed for the TDD approach)

## Estimated Effort

Medium-Large (4-6 hours)

## Priority

Highest (must be completed first for TDD approach)

## Assignee

## Status

Completed

## Implementation Notes

The test suite has been implemented following TDD principles. All tests are designed to initially fail since the implementation doesn't exist yet. The following test files have been created:

1. `tests/serialization/test_serializable_yaml.py` - Tests for Serializable base class YAML methods
2. `tests/serialization/test_flockagent_yaml.py` - Tests for FlockAgent YAML serialization
3. `tests/serialization/test_flock_yaml.py` - Tests for Flock system YAML serialization
4. `tests/serialization/test_callable_reference.py` - Tests for callable reference system
5. `tests/serialization/test_yaml_integration.py` - Integration tests across components

Key features of the test implementation:

- Mock classes used to represent serializable objects
- All major aspects of serialization are covered with specific test cases
- Edge cases and error conditions are included
- Tests are designed to be maintainable and well-documented
- Integration tests verify end-to-end serialization workflows
- Performance comparison tests are included

The tests can be run using `uv run pytest tests/serialization`. As expected in TDD, most tests currently fail with NotImplementedError exceptions, which is correct since the implementation tasks are separate and will be completed next.
