# Task: FlockAgent YAML Examples

## ID

US007-T002.2

## User Story Reference

[US007-YAML-Serialization](../userstories/US007-YAML-Serialization.md)

## Description

Create a set of example YAML files for common FlockAgent configurations that can serve as templates and reference implementations for users. These examples will demonstrate best practices for creating and customizing agents via YAML.

## Status

Not Started

## Required Changes

1. **Basic Agent Examples**:
   - Create examples of simple agents with minimal configuration
   - Include examples with different input/output schemas
   - Provide examples for different model configurations

2. **Tool Usage Examples**:
   - Create examples showing how to configure agents with various tools
   - Include examples of custom tool registration and usage
   - Demonstrate tool combinations for different use cases

3. **Component Integration Examples**:
   - Provide examples with different evaluators
   - Show how to configure modules for extending functionality
   - Demonstrate router configuration for workflow handoff

4. **Specialized Agent Examples**:
   - Create examples for common use cases (content generation, summarization, etc.)
   - Include examples for different domains and applications
   - Show how to optimize agents for specific tasks

5. **Documentation and Comments**:
   - Include extensive comments explaining configuration choices
   - Document common pitfalls and how to avoid them
   - Provide notes on performance considerations

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A comprehensive set of example YAML files covers common agent configurations
2. Examples are organized in a logical structure for easy reference
3. Each example includes extensive comments explaining the configuration
4. All examples can be loaded by the framework without modification
5. Examples follow best practices for YAML formatting and structure
6. Examples are included in the repository and referenced in documentation

## Testing

1. Verify that all example files can be loaded by the framework
2. Test examples with sample inputs to ensure they function as described
3. Confirm that examples cover the full range of framework capabilities
4. Check that comments accurately describe the functionality

## Notes

- Examples should be based on real-world use cases whenever possible
- Consider creating a dedicated "examples" directory for these templates
- Ensure consistency in naming and structure across all examples
- Test examples with multiple model providers to ensure compatibility
