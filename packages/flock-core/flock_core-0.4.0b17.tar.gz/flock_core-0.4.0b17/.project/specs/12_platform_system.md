# Flock Platform System Specification

## Overview
The platform system provides utilities for managing infrastructure dependencies required by the Flock framework. It includes tools for working with Docker containers, setting up observability infrastructure, and managing system dependencies. This specification defines the components and behavior of the platform system.

**Core Implementation:** `src/flock/platform/`

## Core Components

### 1. Docker Tools

**Implementation:** `src/flock/platform/docker_tools.py`

**Purpose:**
Manages Docker instance availability for containerized dependencies.

**Key Features:**
- Check if Docker daemon is running
- Attempt to start Docker service if not running
- Provide utility functions for Docker-related operations

**API:**
- `_check_docker_running()`: Verify Docker daemon is available
- `_start_docker()`: Attempt to start Docker service

### 2. Jaeger Installer

**Implementation:** `src/flock/platform/jaeger_install.py`

**Purpose:**
Provides functionality to set up and verify Jaeger tracing infrastructure.

**Key Features:**
- Check if Jaeger is running and accessible
- Provision Jaeger container using Docker
- Configure transport protocols (gRPC, HTTP)

**API:**
- `_check_jaeger_running()`: Verify Jaeger endpoint is accessible
- `_is_jaeger_container_running()`: Check if Jaeger container exists
- `_provision_jaeger_container()`: Create and start a Jaeger container

## Platform Integration

### Observability Integration
- The platform system sets up infrastructure for OpenTelemetry tracing
- Jaeger provides visualization and storage for trace data
- Trace data flows from the application to Jaeger via configured endpoints

### Containerization Integration
- Docker tools enable containerized infrastructure components
- Platform utilities ensure required containers are available
- Error handling for container provisioning failures

## Design Principles

1. **Infrastructure as Code**:
   - Programmatic management of infrastructure dependencies
   - Declarative configuration of component requirements
   - Automatic provisioning of necessary resources

2. **Self-healing Infrastructure**:
   - Automatic detection of missing dependencies
   - Attempted recovery of required services
   - Graceful handling of infrastructure failures

3. **Observability First**:
   - Built-in tracing infrastructure setup
   - Integrated monitoring capabilities
   - Visualization of system performance

4. **Development Convenience**:
   - Simplified setup of complex infrastructure
   - Developer-friendly interfaces
   - Minimal manual intervention required

## Implementation Requirements

1. Docker must be available on the host system
2. Appropriate permissions for starting services
3. Network connectivity for container provisioning
4. Port availability for service exposure
5. Proper error handling for infrastructure failures
