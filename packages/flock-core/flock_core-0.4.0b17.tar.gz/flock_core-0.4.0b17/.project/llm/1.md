Okay, here are the refactored versions of `flock.py` and the new files created according to the plan (`flock_serializer.py`, `loader.py`, `api/runner.py`, `cli/runner.py`).

***

**1. `src/flock/core/flock.py` (Refactored)**

This file now focuses on the core `Flock` class responsibilities: initialization, agent management, and execution orchestration. Serialization logic is delegated.

```python


```

***

**2. `src/flock/core/serialization/flock_serializer.py` (New)**

This new file contains the `FlockSerializer` class, which encapsulates all the serialization and deserialization logic previously in `Flock`.

```python


```

***

**3. `src/flock/core/loader.py` (New)**

This new file contains the standalone function for loading a Flock instance from a file.

```python


```

***

**4. `src/flock/api/runner.py` (New)**

Contains the function to start the API server, taking a `Flock` instance.

```python


```

***

**5. `src/flock/cli/runner.py` (New)**

Contains the function to start the CLI, taking a `Flock` instance.

```python

```

**To Complete the Refactoring:**

1.  **Place Files:** Put these files in the correct directories within your `src/flock/` structure.
2.  **Update Imports:** Go through `flock.py`, `flock_serializer.py`, `loader.py`, `api/runner.py`, `cli/runner.py`, and any files that previously used `Flock.load_from_file`, `flock.start_api`, or `flock.start_cli` and update the imports to point to the new locations.
3.  **Testing:** Thoroughly test the serialization (`to_yaml_file`, `from_yaml_file`, etc.) and loading (`load_flock_from_file`) functionalities, as well as the API and CLI startup commands, to ensure no behavior has changed unintentionally. Pay close attention to cases involving custom types, components, and tools.
