# Flock Framework Specifications

This document serves as an index for the reverse-engineered specifications of the Flock framework. These specifications document the design decisions, architecture, and components that have been implemented in the current version of the framework.

## Overview

Flock is a declarative agent framework that focuses on simplifying the creation and orchestration of AI agents. The framework emphasizes:

1. **Declarative agent definition** - focusing on inputs and outputs rather than prompts
2. **Composable workflows** - allowing agents to be connected in pipelines
3. **Extensible architecture** - supporting modules, tools, and custom evaluators
4. **Production-ready features** - including distributed execution and observability

   - Specifies serialization requirements
   - Documents error handling and recovery

8. [**Context System**](specs/08_context_system.md)
   - Outlines the shared state mechanism
   - Defines context propagation requirements
   - Specifies context access patterns

9. [**CLI System**](specs/09_cli_system.md)
   - Defines the command-line interface architecture
   - Specifies modules like the Settings Editor
   - Documents environment profile management
   - Outlines UI components and navigation patterns

10. [**Workflow System**](specs/10_workflow_system.md)
    - Defines Temporal workflow integration
    - Specifies activity implementation for agent chains
    - Documents workflow execution flow
    - Outlines tracing and observability features

    - Defines centralized component management
    - Specifies registration of agents, callables, types, and components
    - Documents decorator system for easy registration
    - Outlines dynamic import capabilities

14. [**Serialization System**](specs/14_serialization_system.md)
    - Defines conversion of components to various formats
    - Specifies serialization interfaces and utilities
    - Documents support for multiple serialization formats
    - Outlines secure serialization capabilities

## Design Principles

These specifications reveal several core design principles that guided the development of Flock:

1. **Separation of Concerns** - Each component has a specific responsibility with clear boundaries
2. **Extensibility First** - All major components support extension or replacement
3. **Declarative Over Imperative** - Focus on what agents do, not how they do it
4. **Production Readiness** - Support for distributed execution, observability, and error handling
5. **Developer Experience** - Simplified API with sensible defaults and clear patterns
6. **User-Friendly Interface** - Intuitive CLI with clear navigation and helpful feedback
7. **Centralized Registry** - Single source of truth for component registration and lookup
8. **Serialization Support** - Comprehensive support for storing and sharing components

## Implementation Status

These specifications reflect the current implementation of the Flock framework. While some components may be more mature than others, the overall architecture is well-established and provides a solid foundation for building agent systems.

## Future Directions

Based on the specifications, potential future enhancements could include:

1. More specialized evaluators for different use cases
2. Enhanced observability and debugging tools
3. Additional module types for common agent patterns
4. Expanded router capabilities for complex workflows
5. Integration with additional execution engines beyond Temporal
6. Extended CLI functionality for agent management and monitoring
7. Advanced memory capabilities for improved agent reasoning
8. Enhanced serialization for cross-platform compatibility
