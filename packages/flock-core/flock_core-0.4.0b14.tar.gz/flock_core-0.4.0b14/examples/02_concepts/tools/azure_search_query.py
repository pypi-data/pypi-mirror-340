# Defining our output model
#
# Being able to declaratively specify requirements for each field is a powerful feature of flock
# and makes prompting much more effective, easier to understand and easier to maintain.
#
# Let's take a look at the RAGResponse model:
# answer - The final answer to the user query.
# max_queries - Flock will retry failed tool calls quite a bit (10 times), so the max_queries is a way to limit the number of retries semantically.
# queries - Flock should log the queries it used to answer the question.
# error - In case no answer is found after max_queries are used, an error should be returned.
# source_documents - Flock should log the source documents used to answer the question.
# quotes - Flock should log the quotes from the source documents to support the answer.
# 
# As you can see just by simply defining declarative rules for each field,
# we implicitly created a quite complex logical flow that is quite hard to get right with plain prompting.
#
# This way it is not necessary to write a behemoth of a prompt to get the desired behavior.
# It gives the developer the ability to pin-point exactly what should happen on an elementary field-by-field basis.
#
# Better results with less time wasted on writing complex prompts.

# Let's take a look at the rag_agent:
#
# Description, input and output are following the same declarative approach as the RAGResponse model.
#
# Let's take a look at those fields:
#
# Description - Not only useful for documentation, but also useful to tell Flock what to do.
# Input - We define the 'question' and 'max_queries' as input and some rules for max_queries.
# Output - We define the 'answer' to be of type RAGResponse, which makes all the rules we defined above come into play.
#
# Also we wrap all those rules into another rule that the answer should be in the same language as the question.
#
# Tools - We define the tools that Flock should use to answer the question.
