# Settings Editor UI Components

## Summary
Design and implement user interface components for the environment settings editor, focusing on clean, intuitive interaction patterns.

## Description
The settings editor needs several UI components that provide a consistent and intuitive experience. This includes menus, tables for displaying variables, input prompts, confirmation dialogs, and formatting for different types of data. The UI should be accessible and responsive, using the Rich and Questionary libraries effectively.

## User Story
[US001 - Environment Settings Editor](../../userstories/done/US001-Settings-Editor.md)

## Technical Requirements
- Create a main menu UI with clear options for all settings editor functions
- Design a paginated table display for environment variables
- Implement masked display for sensitive information (passwords, API keys)
- Create input forms for adding/editing variables with validation
- Implement confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- Design status messages and error notifications
- Ensure consistent styling throughout the interface
- Support keyboard navigation and shortcuts

## Implementation Plan
1. Design a menu structure using Questionary
2. Create a table display component for variables using Rich
3. Implement input forms with validation
4. Create confirmation dialogs
5. Design status messages and notifications
6. Implement keyboard shortcuts
7. Add styling constants for consistent appearance
8. Test UI components with different screen sizes and terminal types

## Definition of Done
- All UI components render correctly
- Navigation between components is intuitive
- Input validation provides clear feedback
- Sensitive information is appropriately masked
- Error messages are clear and helpful
- UI is consistent across different terminal sizes
- Code is well-documented and follows project conventions
