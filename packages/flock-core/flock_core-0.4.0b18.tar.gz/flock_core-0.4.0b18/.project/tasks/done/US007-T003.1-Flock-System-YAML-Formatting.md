# Task: Flock System YAML Formatting

## ID

US007-T003.1

## User Story Reference

[US007-YAML-Serialization](../userstories/US007-YAML-Serialization.md)

## Description

Enhance the YAML serialization for Flock systems to produce more human-readable output for multi-agent configurations. This task focuses on improving the formatting, organization, and documentation of Flock YAML files to make them more accessible for manual editing and understanding.

## Status

Not Started

## Required Changes

1. **Enhanced System Structure**:
   - Create a custom `to_yaml` method specifically for Flock
   - Organize agent definitions in a clear, hierarchical structure
   - Group related agents and components logically

2. **System-Level Documentation**:
   - Add a header with system metadata (creation date, version, purpose)
   - Include an overview of the system's workflow and agent relationships
   - Document global settings and their impact on the system

3. **Agent Relationship Documentation**:
   - Clearly document the handoff relationships between agents
   - Visualize workflows using comments or metadata
   - Explain the overall flow of data through the system

4. **Workflow Explanation**:
   - Document entry points and expected inputs
   - Explain branching logic and decision points
   - Provide examples of typical execution paths

5. **Global Resources**:
   - Organize shared tools, evaluators, and other resources
   - Document resource dependencies between agents
   - Use YAML anchors and references for shared components

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Flock YAML output includes an overview of the system architecture
2. Agent relationships and workflows are clearly documented
3. The format supports complex multi-agent systems with clear organization
4. All components are adequately documented with usage instructions
5. YAML files maintain compatibility with the existing parser
6. System-wide settings and configurations are clearly explained

## Testing

1. Test with systems of varying complexity (2+ agents, 5+ agents, 10+ agents)
2. Verify that all relationships are accurately represented
3. Test that workflow comments match actual execution flow
4. Ensure that complex systems remain readable and navigable

## Notes

- Consider using visual representation techniques in comments when possible
- Balance between comment verbosity and file readability
- Consider implementing a visualization tool that can read the YAML and generate workflow diagrams
- Ensure all documentation is accurate and synchronized with code behavior
