# Task: YAML Documentation and Examples

## ID

US007-T005

## User Story Reference

[US007-YAML-Serialization](../userstories/US007-YAML-Serialization.md)

## Description

Create comprehensive documentation for the YAML serialization feature, focusing on user guides, tutorials, and integration documentation rather than schema details or specific examples (which are covered in other tasks).

## Status

Not Started

## Required Changes

1. **Feature Overview Documentation**:
   - Create a high-level overview of YAML serialization capabilities
   - Document the benefits of YAML over JSON and other formats
   - Explain how YAML serialization fits into the Flock architecture

2. **User Guides**:
   - Create step-by-step guides for common YAML serialization tasks
   - Document how to convert between formats (JSON to YAML, YAML to JSON)
   - Provide guidelines for manually creating and editing YAML files

3. **Integration Documentation**:
   - Document how to integrate YAML serialization with existing code
   - Explain how to load and save YAML configurations programmatically
   - Provide guidance on extending the YAML serialization system

4. **Troubleshooting Guide**:
   - Create documentation on common issues and their solutions
   - Provide guidance on debugging YAML parsing errors
   - Include a FAQ section addressing common questions

5. **Migration Guide**:
   - Document how to migrate from JSON to YAML formats
   - Provide tools or scripts to facilitate migration
   - Document version compatibility considerations

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the YAML serialization feature
2. Step-by-step guides exist for common tasks and workflows
3. Documentation explains integration with existing code and systems
4. Documentation includes troubleshooting information and solutions
5. All documentation is clear, accurate, and up-to-date with implementation

## Testing

1. Review documentation with team members for accuracy and clarity
2. Verify that steps in guides work as described
3. Test integration examples to ensure they function properly
4. Ensure documentation remains synchronized with code as changes occur
