# Task: FlockAgent YAML Formatting

## ID

US007-T002.1

## User Story Reference

[US007-YAML-Serialization](../userstories/US007-YAML-Serialization.md)

## Description

Enhance the YAML serialization for FlockAgent to produce more human-readable output with proper formatting, documentation comments, and structure. While basic YAML serialization functionality exists by inheriting from the Serializable base class, the output lacks the human-friendly aspects that would make manual editing easier.

## Status

Not Started

## Required Changes

1. **Enhanced YAML Output Methods**:
   - Create a custom `to_yaml` method specifically for FlockAgent
   - Implement proper indentation and structure for nested components
   - Add descriptive comments for each section and field

2. **Commented Headers**:
   - Add a header with agent creation timestamp, version, and purpose
   - Include description of how to edit the file
   - Document relationships with other agents if applicable

3. **Field Documentation**:
   - Add inline comments explaining the purpose of each field
   - Document acceptable values and formats for each field
   - Provide examples of valid values directly in the comments

4. **Tool References**:
   - Improve the format of tool references to be more descriptive
   - Add comments explaining how to add or modify tools
   - Group tools by purpose or functionality

5. **Component Formatting**:
   - Format evaluators, routers, and modules with clear sections
   - Add section headers and separators for better visual organization
   - Ensure configurations are properly documented

## Acceptance Criteria

1. FlockAgent YAML output includes descriptive comments for all major fields
2. The format is consistently structured for easy reading and navigation
3. YAML files can be read and understood without referring to external documentation
4. Generated comments explain how to modify values safely
5. All YAML files maintain compatibility with the existing parser
6. The implementation handles complex nested structures cleanly

## Testing

1. Test that comments are preserved during round-trip serialization
2. Verify that format is consistent across different agent configurations
3. Test with agents containing all possible component types
4. Ensure human-readability doesn't break parsing functionality

## Notes

- Consider using YAML anchors and references for common configuration patterns
- Investigate using YAML comments (# lines) vs metadata fields for documentation
- Remember that while comments enhance readability, the FlockAgent must still be able to parse the YAML without depending on them
