Title: Building Your First Flock Agent

In this example, we'll walk you through creating and running a simple Flock system with a single agent.
Flock enables you to build LLM-powered agents by simply declaring what data each agent receives and what it
producesâ€”no more tedious prompt engineering!

What you'll learn:
  - How to set up the Flock model (using litellm; check out https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers for valid model IDs).
  - How to create a Flock instance that serves as the central orchestrator and context holder.
  - How to define a simple agent (named "bloggy") by declaring its input and output.
  - How to add the agent to your Flock.
  - How to run the agent workflow asynchronously in local debug mode (without needing Temporal).

The "bloggy" agent in this example is designed to take a blog idea as input and generate a funny blog title
along with a list of blog headers as output.

Let's get started!

flock.add_agent(bloggy)
