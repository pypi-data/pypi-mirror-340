# Settings Security Features

## Summary
Implement security features for the environment settings editor to protect sensitive information.

## Description
The settings editor needs to implement several security features to protect sensitive information like API keys, passwords, and tokens. This includes masking sensitive values in the display, providing options to show/hide secrets, and implementing secure input methods.

## User Story
[US001 - Environment Settings Editor](../../userstories/done/US001-Settings-Editor.md)

## Technical Requirements
- Implement masking for sensitive variables (containing words like PASSWORD, KEY, TOKEN, SECRET)
- Add toggle functionality to show/hide masked values
- Create secure input methods for adding/editing sensitive variables
- Store backup files in a secure location with appropriate permissions
- Implement warning messages when editing sensitive variables
- Provide guidance for secure environment variable management
- Add logging for security-related events with appropriate obfuscation

## Implementation Plan
1. Implement detection of sensitive variables
2. Create masking functionality for display
3. Add toggle for showing/hiding masked values
4. Implement secure input methods
5. Create secure backup handling
6. Add warning messages for sensitive operations
7. Implement secure logging

## Definition of Done
- Sensitive variables are detected and masked by default
- Users can toggle visibility of masked values
- Secure input methods are used for sensitive variables
- Backup files have appropriate permissions
- Warning messages are displayed for sensitive operations
- Logging doesn't expose sensitive information
- Documentation provides guidance on secure usage

## Dependencies
- Core settings editor functionality
- Environment file operations

## Estimated Effort
Small - Approximately 2-3 hours of development time

## Priority
High

## Assignee
TBD

## Status
Completed - May 23, 2024

## Implementation Notes
- Implemented detection of sensitive variables using keyword matching
