TODO, .py files in this directory can be deleted, since they are moved to the
`docs/tutorials` directory.

But, the data set files in this directory are used by the tutorials, so they should be
kept.


To learn how to use KLIFF, begin with the tutorials.

:ref:`tut_kim_sw`: a good entry point to see the basics of training a physics-motivated
potential.

:ref:`tut_params_transform`: it is similar to :ref:`tut_kim_sw`, except that some
parameters are transformed to the log space for optimization.

:ref:`tut_nn`: walks through the steps to train a machine-learning neural network
potential.

:ref:`tut_nn_multi_spec`: similar to :ref:`tut_nn`, but train for a system of multiple
species.

:ref:`tut_lj`: similar to :ref:`tut_kim_sw` (where a KIM model is used), here the
Lennard-Jones model built in KLIFF is used.

More examples can be found at `<https://github.com/openkim/kliff/tree/master/examples>`_.
