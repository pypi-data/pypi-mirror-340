"""
CausalTorch: Causal Neural-Symbolic Generative Networks
======================================================

A PyTorch library for building generative models with causal constraints.

Key components:
- CNSG models for text, image, and video generation with causal rules
- Graph-based causal rule definition and visualization
- Specialized neural layers for enforcing causal constraints 
- Metrics for evaluating causal fidelity and consistency
