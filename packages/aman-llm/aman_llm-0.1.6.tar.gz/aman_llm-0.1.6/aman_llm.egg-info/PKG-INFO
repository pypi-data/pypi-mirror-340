# aman_llm

**`aman_llm`** is a simple Python package that enables AI-powered file and shell operations using Google's Gemini API. It uses agent-based logic to interpret natural language instructions and perform system-level tasks like creating files, navigating directories, and more — all powered by LLMs.

---

## 🚀 Installation

```bash
pip install aman_llm
```

---

## 🔐 Environment Setup

To use `aman_llm`, you must provide a Gemini API key.

### Step 1: Get Your Gemini API Key

Visit the following URL and generate your API key:

👉 [https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)

### Step 2: Create a `.env` File

In your project root, create a `.env` file and add the following:

```env
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key-here
```

This key will be used to authenticate with Gemini when calling the LLM.

## ✅ Example Usage

```python
from aman_llm import llm_call

llm_call("Create a file named 'integer.txt' and write numbers 1 to 10 in it", stream=True)
```
