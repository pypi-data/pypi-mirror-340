# Phone MCP Plugin

A phone control plugin for MCP that allows you to control your Android phone to connect any human.

[中文文档](README_zh.md)

## Using Phone MCP in Claude and Cursor

### Installation
```bash
uvx phone-mcp
```

### Cursor Configuration
Configure in `~/.cursor/mcp.json`:
```json
"phone-mcp": {
    "command": "uvx",
    "args": [
        "phone-mcp"
    ]
}
```

### Using in Claude
Claude can directly call the following phone control functions:

- **Call Functions**: Make calls, end calls, receive incoming calls
- **Messaging Functions**: Send SMS, receive recent messages
- **Contact Functions**: Access phone contacts
- **Media Functions**: Take screenshots, record screen, control media playback
- **App Functions**: Open applications, set alarms
- **System Functions**: Get window info, app shortcuts, launch specific activities

### Example Commands
Use directly in Claude conversations:
- Check device connection: `mcp_phone_mcp_check_device_connection`
- Make a phone call: `mcp_phone_mcp_call_number`
- Send a text message: `mcp_phone_mcp_send_text_message`
- Get contacts: `mcp_phone_mcp_get_contacts`
- Take a screenshot: `mcp_phone_mcp_take_screenshot`
- Get app shortcuts: `mcp_phone_mcp_get_app_shortcuts`
- Get window info: `mcp_phone_mcp_get_current_window`
- Launch specific activity: `mcp_phone_mcp_launch_activity`

No additional configuration is needed. As long as ADB is properly installed and configured, Claude can directly control your Android device.

## Installation

Install the package from PyPI:

```bash
pip install phone-mcp
```

Or install with UVX:

```bash
uvx phone-mcp
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Android device with USB debugging enabled
- ADB installed and configured on your system

## ADB Setup (Required)

This package requires ADB (Android Debug Bridge) to be installed on your computer and properly connected to your Android device.

### Installing ADB

1. **Windows**:
   - Download [Platform Tools](https://developer.android.com/tools/releases/platform-tools) from Google
   - Extract the zip file to a location on your computer (e.g., `C:\android-sdk`)
   - Add the Platform Tools directory to your PATH environment variable

2. **macOS**:
   - Install via Homebrew: `brew install android-platform-tools`
   - Or download Platform Tools from the link above

3. **Linux**:
   - Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get install adb`
   - Fedora: `sudo dnf install android-tools`
   - Or download Platform Tools from the link above

### Connecting Your Android Device

1. **Enable USB Debugging**:
   - On your Android device, go to Settings > About phone
   - Tap "Build number" seven times to enable Developer options
   - Go back to Settings > System > Developer options
   - Enable "USB debugging"

2. **Connect Device**:
   - Connect your phone to your computer with a USB cable
   - Accept the USB debugging authorization prompt on your phone
   - Verify the connection by running `adb devices` in your terminal/command prompt
   - You should see your device listed as "device" (not "unauthorized" or "offline")

3. **Troubleshooting**:
   - If your device shows as "unauthorized", check for a prompt on your phone
   - If no devices are shown, try:
     - Different USB cable or port
     - Restart ADB server with `adb kill-server` followed by `adb start-server`
     - Install manufacturer-specific USB drivers (Windows)

### Verifying Connection

Before using this package, verify that ADB can detect your device:

```bash
# Check if your device is properly connected
adb devices

# Expected output:
# List of devices attached
# XXXXXXXX    device
```

## Configuration

The plugin includes several configurable options that can be customized:

### Country Code

By default, the country code `+86` (China) is used when making calls or sending messages. You can change this by editing the `config.py` file:

```python
# In phone_mcp/config.py
DEFAULT_COUNTRY_CODE = "+1"  # Change to your country code (e.g., "+1" for US)
```

### Storage Paths

Screenshot and recording paths can be customized:

```python
# Screenshot storage location on the device
SCREENSHOT_PATH = "/sdcard/Pictures/Screenshots/"

# Screen recording storage location on the device
RECORDING_PATH = "/sdcard/Movies/"
```

### Command Behavior

Timeouts and auto-retry settings:

```python
# Maximum time (seconds) to wait for a command to complete
COMMAND_TIMEOUT = 30

# Whether to automatically retry connecting to the device
AUTO_RETRY_CONNECTION = True

# Maximum number of connection retry attempts
MAX_RETRY_COUNT = 3
```

## Features

- Make and receive phone calls
- Send and receive text messages
- Take screenshots and record screen
- Control media playback
- Open apps and set alarms
- Check device connection
- Access and manage contacts

## Usage

### Using as an MCP Plugin

When used as an MCP plugin, the functionality will be available through your MCP interface.

### Command Line Interface

The package also provides a command line interface for direct access to phone functions:

```bash
# Check device connection (use this first to verify setup)
