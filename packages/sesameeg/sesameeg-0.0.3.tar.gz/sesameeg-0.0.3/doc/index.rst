SESAMEEG
========

SESAMEEG is a Python3 library providing the Bayesian multi-dipole localization method
SESAME [1]_ (SEquential Semi-Analytic Montecarlo Estimator) for the automatic estimation of
brain source currents from MEEG data, either in the time domain and in the frequency domain [2]_.

A mathematical description of the algorithm is available in the
:doc:`documentation <explanation_algorithm>`.


Installation
============

To install this package, the easiest way is using ``pip``. It will install both
``sesameeg`` and its dependencies. The ``setup.py`` depends on ``numpy``, ``scipy``  and ``mne``
for the installation so it is advised to install them beforehand.
To install this package, please run the following commands:

(Latest stable version)

.. code::

    pip install numpy scipy mne
    pip install sesameeg

If you do not have admin privileges on the computer, use the ``--user`` flag
with ``pip``. To upgrade, use the ``--upgrade`` flag provided by ``pip``.

To check if everything worked fine, you can run:

.. code::

    python -c 'import sesameeg'

and it should not give any error messages.


Bug reports
===========

Use the `github issue tracker <https://github.com/pybees/sesameeg/issues>`_ to report bugs.
