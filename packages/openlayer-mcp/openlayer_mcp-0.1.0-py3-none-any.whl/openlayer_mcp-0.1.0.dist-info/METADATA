# Openlayer MCP

[MCP](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol) (Model Context Protocol) server for
the Openlayer platform. This allows MCP clients (such as Cursor, VSCode,
Claude Desktop, etc.) to interact with the Openlayer platform.

## Installation

```bash
uv add openlayer-mcp
```
or

```bash
pip install openlayer-mcp
```

## Usage

To use the Openlayer MCP server in your IDE or desktop app, you need to add it
to the MCP configuration file.

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "openlayer": {
            "command": "uvx",
            "args": [
                "openlayer_mcp"
            ],
            "env": {
                "OPENLAYER_API_KEY": "YOUR_OPENLAYER_API_KEY_HERE"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

You can alternatively run it as a standalone server with:

```bash
uv run -m openlayer_mcp
```
