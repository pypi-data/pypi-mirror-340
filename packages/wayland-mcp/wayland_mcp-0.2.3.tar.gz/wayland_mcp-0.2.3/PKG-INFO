# Wayland MCP Server

> **Note:** This package was created because existing screenshot solutions didn't work reliably on my Wayland setup.  
> **Wayland MCP** provides advanced screenshot, analysis, and mouse control tools for modern Linux desktops.

## Input Control Setup

### ‚ö° Enabling Mouse Functionality

To enable mouse control features (move, click, drag, scroll), **run the setup script**:

```

This script will configure the necessary permissions for `evemu-event`, allowing the MCP server to control the mouse.
