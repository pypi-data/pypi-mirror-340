# plusdeck.dbus.interface

This module contains the core `DbusInterface` class. This class is used directly to serve the interface, and is subclassed by the `DbusClient` class in `plusdeck.dbus.client`.

You will likely not use this module directly. For information on the client, see [`plusdeck.dbus.client`](./plusdeck.dbus.client.md). For information on the service, see [`plusdeck.dbus.service`](./plusdeck.dbus.service.md).
