# plusdeck.dbus.client

This module contains the core `DbusClient` abstraction, which is used to interact with a DBus service.

For information on how to use `plusdeck` domain objects with the DBus client, see [the API docs for `plusdeck.dbus.domain`](./plusdeck.dbus.domain.md). For examples of how to use the DBus client, look at [the source code for `plusdeckctl`](https://github.com/jfhbrook/plusdeck/blob/main/plusdeck/dbus/client/cli.py).
