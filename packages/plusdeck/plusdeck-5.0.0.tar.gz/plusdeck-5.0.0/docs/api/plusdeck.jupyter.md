# plusdeck.jupyter

This library also includes some simple Jupyter widgets, under the `plusdeck.jupyter` namespace. These are `ConfigEditor`, for editing the CLI configuration file, and `player`, for spawning a simple player UI. To see these in action, check out the `Player.ipynb` file in the root of this project.
