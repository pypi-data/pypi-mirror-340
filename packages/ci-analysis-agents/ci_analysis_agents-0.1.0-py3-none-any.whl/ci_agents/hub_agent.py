    "1. failed by lab environment issue;  [Lab_Issue]"
    "2. failed by infrastructure issue; [Infrastructure_Issue]"
    "3. failed by third-party issue; [Third_Party_Issue]"

    "You have the following tools available:\n"
    1.lab_agent: Analyze if failure is caused by a lab environment issue
    (other tools are not implemented yet)
    each tool will return a json format result, and you need to decide the final analysis result by calling the tools and decide the final analysis result.
    Use these tools to investigate the failure. Always check for meaningful log data before responding directly.
    please note that the context could be not completed and in each agent tool, it could retrieve more context to analyze the failure logs.
    #Output Requirements:
    If you decide the failure was caused by the issue as agent tools(eg:lab_agent),  you should reuse and return its result (e.g., failed_by_env, action_insight, etc.) as your final structured response, possibly adding your own insights if helpful.
