description = "A high-performance Python library for interfacing with the RPLidar C1 360-degree laser scanner. This library provides a fully asynchronous API for non-blocking operation, enabling efficient control of the RPLidar device and real-time processing of scan data. Built with modern Python async/await syntax and designed with minimal external dependencies (only pyserial required), it offers a lightweight yet powerful solution for robotics and sensing applications."
