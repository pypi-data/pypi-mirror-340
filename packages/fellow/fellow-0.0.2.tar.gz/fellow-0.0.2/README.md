# Fellow

## Project Description
**Fellow** is a command-line interface (CLI) tool that acts as an autonomous software engineering assistant. It uses the OpenAI API to perform various structured tasks by reasoning step-by-step, executing commands, and maintaining a log of its activities.

---

## Installation
Make sure you have Python installed on your system. Then install Fellow via [pip](https://pypi.org/project/fellow/):
```bash
pip install fellow
```

## Usage
Since Fellow uses the OpenAI API you have to set your `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your environment variables. You can do this by running:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"
```

Fellow is designed to run based on a configuration provided via a YAML file. A typical usage example:
```bash
fellow --config task.yml
```

In the YAML configuration, you can specify tasks that Fellow will carry out. Supported commands include file operations, code execution, and more. Example:
```yaml
task: |
  write a readme file for this Python project
``` 
For more configuration options, see the [default_fellow_config.yml](fellow/default_fellow_config.yml) file in the repository.
