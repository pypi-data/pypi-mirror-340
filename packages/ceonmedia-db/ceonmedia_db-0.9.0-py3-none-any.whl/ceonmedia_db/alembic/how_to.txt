From the folder containing the "alembic.ini" file:

--- Migration ---
Auto-generate alembic migration file:

    alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Added account table"

After reviewing/editing the migration file...
run the migration:

    alembic upgrade head

--- Complete Reset ---
1. Delete the DB in heroku.
2. Delete all migration files
3. Tell alembic that all current migrations (none in our case) represent the latest 
version of hte db: 

        alembic stamp head

4. Run a standard migration workflow (create revision then upgrade head)
