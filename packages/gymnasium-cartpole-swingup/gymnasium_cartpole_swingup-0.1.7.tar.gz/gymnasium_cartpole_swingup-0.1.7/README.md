A more challenging version of the classic CartPole environment for Gymnasium where the pole starts in a downward position.

## Description

This package provides a port of the CartPole SwingUp environment to the modern [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/) API. It is based on:
- [zuoxingdong/DeepPILCO](https://github.com/zuoxingdong/DeepPILCO/blob/master/cartpole_swingup.py)
- [hardmaru/estool](https://github.com/hardmaru/estool/blob/master/custom_envs/cartpole_swingup.py)

The environment has been updated to work with the latest Gymnasium interface and includes enhanced rendering capabilities.

## Installation

```bash
# Using pip
pip install gymnasium-cartpole-swingup

# Using uv
uv add gymnasium-cartpole-swingup
```

## Usage

```python
import gymnasium as gym
import gymnasium_cartpole_swingup  # This import is required to register the environment, even if unused

# Create the environment
env = gym.make("CartPoleSwingUp-v0", render_mode="human")
observation, info = env.reset(seed=42)

for _ in range(1000):
    action = env.action_space.sample()
    observation, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(action)
    
    if terminated or truncated:
        observation, info = env.reset()

env.close()
```

### Custom Initial State

You can reset the environment to any arbitrary initial state using the `options` parameter:

```python
import gymnasium as gym
import numpy as np
import gymnasium_cartpole_swingup

# Create the environment
env = gym.make("CartPoleSwingUp-v0")

# Reset with a specific initial state: [x, x_dot, theta, theta_dot]
# Example: Start with pole at 45 degrees (π/4 radians) and no movement
obs, info = env.reset(options={"initial_state": [0.0, 0.0, np.pi/4, 0.0]})

# The default reset (randomized around downward position)
obs, info = env.reset()
```

The `initial_state` option allows you to specify any exact initial state as `[x, x_dot, theta, theta_dot]`. This is useful for:
- Testing policies from specific starting conditions
- Curriculum learning with progressively harder initial states
- Reproducible experiments with specific starting points
- Evaluating robustness across different initial conditions

### Customizing Environment Parameters

You can customize the physics parameters of the environment by passing them to `gym.make()`:

```python
# Create an environment with custom parameters
env = gym.make(
    "CartPoleSwingUp-v0",
    render_mode="human",
    gravity=9.81,             # Gravitational acceleration (m/s²)
    cart_mass=1.0,            # Mass of the cart (kg)
    pole_mass=0.1,            # Mass of the pole (kg)
    pole_length=0.6,          # Length of the pole (m)
    force_mag=10.0,           # Force magnitude scale applied to cart
    friction=0.05,            # Friction coefficient
    x_threshold=2.5,          # Cart position limit (left/right boundary)
    cost_mode="default",      # Cost function mode ("default" or "pilco")
    sigma_c=0.25,             # Sigma parameter for PILCO cost function
    obs_mode="raw",           # Observation mode ("raw" or "trig")
    initial_state_mean=np.array([0.0, 0.0, np.pi, 0.0]),  # Mean of initial state distribution
    initial_state_noise=np.array([0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05]),  # Noise scale for initial state
)
```

The `initial_state_mean` and `initial_state_noise` parameters control the default randomized initialization when not providing a specific initial state:
- `initial_state_mean`: The mean values for the initial state `[x, x_dot, theta, theta_dot]` (default: `[0.0, 0.0, π, 0.0]` - pole pointing down)
- `initial_state_noise`: Standard deviation for each state component (default: `[0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05]`)

### Customizing Reward Function

You can define and use your own custom reward function instead of the built-in ones:

```python
import gymnasium as gym
import numpy as np
import gymnasium_cartpole_swingup

# Define a custom reward function that takes state, action, and next_state
def my_custom_reward(state, action, next_state):
    # Previous state (s_t)
    prev_x, prev_x_dot, prev_theta, prev_theta_dot = state
    
    # Action that was taken (a_t)
    force = action[0]  # Scaled force applied to cart
    
    # Resulting state after the action (s_{t+1})
    x, x_dot, theta, theta_dot = next_state
    
    # Example: Reward based on improvement in pole angle and penalize large actions
    angle_improvement = abs(prev_theta - np.pi) - abs(theta - np.pi)  # Higher when getting closer to upright
    action_penalty = -0.1 * abs(force)  # Small penalty for large actions
    position_penalty = -0.05 * abs(x)   # Small penalty for distance from center
    
    return angle_improvement + action_penalty + position_penalty

# Create environment with custom reward function
env = gym.make('CartPoleSwingUp-v0', custom_reward_fn=my_custom_reward)

# Now the environment will use your custom reward function
```

Your custom reward function should take three parameters:
1. `state`: The state before the action ($s_t = (x_t, \dot{x}_t, \theta_t, \dot{\theta}_t)$)
2. `action`: The action taken ($a_t$, a numpy array containing one value)
3. `next_state`: The resulting state after the action ($s_{t+1} = (x_{t+1}, \dot{x}_{t+1}, \theta_{t+1}, \dot{\theta}_{t+1})$)

The function should return a scalar reward value $r_t = R(s_t, a_t, s_{t+1})$.

**Important**: The custom reward function always receives the internal state representation $(x, \dot{x}, \theta, \dot{\theta})$ regardless of the `obs_mode` setting. Even if you're using `obs_mode="trig"` where observations are $(x, \dot{x}, \sin(\theta), \cos(\theta), \dot{\theta})$, your reward function will still receive the raw internal state. This allows your reward logic to work consistently regardless of the observation format used for learning.

**Note**: The `import gymnasium_cartpole_swingup` line is necessary to register the environment with Gymnasium, even though it may appear unused. If you're using auto-formatters or linters that remove unused imports, you can add a `# noqa` comment or disable that specific check:

```python
import gymnasium_cartpole_swingup  # noqa: F401
```

## Environment Details

- **State**: Initially, the pole hangs downward ($\theta \approx \pi$)
- **Goal**: Swing the pole upright and maintain balance
- **Action Space**: Force applied to cart $[-1, 1]$ (scaled to $[-10, 10]$ N internally)
- **Observation Space**: Depends on the `obs_mode` parameter (see below)
- **Reward**: Higher when pole is upright and cart is centered

This is a more challenging version of the standard [Gymnasium CartPole](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/classic_control/cart_pole/) environment.

### Observation Space Detail

The environment supports two different observation space formats, which can be selected using the `obs_mode` parameter:

#### Raw Mode (`obs_mode="raw"`)

The default observation is a 4-dimensional vector:

| Index | Observation          | Description                            | Min  | Max  |
|-------|---------------------|----------------------------------------|------|------|
| 0     | $x$                 | Cart position along the track           | $-2.4$ | $2.4$  |
| 1     | $\dot{x}$           | Cart velocity                           | $-\infty$ | $\infty$ |
| 2     | $\theta$            | Angle of the pole                       | $-\pi$ | $\pi$  |
| 3     | $\dot{\theta}$      | Angular velocity of the pole            | $-\infty$ | $\infty$ |

#### Trigonometric Mode (`obs_mode="trig"`)

In this mode, the angle $\theta$ is replaced with its sine and cosine components, resulting in a 5-dimensional vector:

| Index | Observation          | Description                            | Min  | Max  |
|-------|---------------------|----------------------------------------|------|------|
| 0     | $x$                 | Cart position along the track           | $-2.4$ | $2.4$  |
| 1     | $\dot{x}$           | Cart velocity                           | $-\infty$ | $\infty$ |
| 2     | $\sin(\theta)$      | Sine of the pole angle                  | $-1.0$ | $1.0$  |
| 3     | $\cos(\theta)$      | Cosine of the pole angle                | $-1.0$ | $1.0$  |
| 4     | $\dot{\theta}$      | Angular velocity of the pole            | $-\infty$ | $\infty$ |

Using the trigonometric mode can be beneficial for learning algorithms as it provides a continuous representation of the angle without discontinuities at $\pm\pi$.

Notes:
- When the pole is upright, $\sin(\theta) = 0$ and $\cos(\theta) = 1$
- When the pole is hanging down, $\sin(\theta) = 0$ and $\cos(\theta) = -1$
- When the pole is horizontal to the right, $\sin(\theta) = 1$ and $\cos(\theta) = 0$
- When the pole is horizontal to the left, $\sin(\theta) = -1$ and $\cos(\theta) = 0$

For the raw mode:
- The angle $\theta$ is in radians and is kept within the range $[-\pi, \pi]$
- When the pole is upright, $\theta = 0$
- When the pole is hanging down, $\theta = \pi$ or $\theta = -\pi$

### Action Space Detail

The action is a 1-dimensional continuous value:

| Index | Action              | Description                            | Min  | Max  |
|-------|---------------------|----------------------------------------|------|------|
| 0     | $F$                 | Horizontal force applied to the cart   | $-1.0$ | $1.0$  |

Notes:
- The force is scaled internally by a factor of $10.0$, resulting in an effective range of $[-10, 10]$ N
- Positive values move the cart to the right
- Negative values move the cart to the left

### Reward Function

The environment supports two built-in reward (or cost) functions, which can be selected using the `cost_mode` parameter, or you can provide your own custom reward function.

#### Default Mode (`cost_mode="default"`)

The default reward function is a product of two components:

$$r(s_t) = \cos(\theta_t) \cdot \cos(x_t)$$

Where:
- $\cos(\theta_t)$ is the pole angle component:
  - Maximum value of $1.0$ when the pole is upright ($\theta = 0$)
  - Minimum value of $-1.0$ when the pole is hanging down ($\theta = \pi$ or $\theta = -\pi$)

- $\cos(x_t)$ is the cart position component:
  - Maximum value of $1.0$ when the cart is centered ($x = 0$)
  - Decreases as the cart moves away from center

#### PILCO Mode (`cost_mode="pilco"`)

The PILCO (Probabilistic Inference for Learning COntrol) cost function is based on the squared distance between the pole tip position and the target position:

$$c(s_t) = 1 - \exp\left(-\frac{d^2}{2\sigma_c^2}\right)$$

$$r(s_t) = -c(s_t)$$

Where:
- $d = \sqrt{(x_{\text{tip}} - x_{\text{target}})^2 + (y_{\text{tip}} - y_{\text{target}})^2}$ is the Euclidean distance between the current pole tip position and the target position
- $x_{\text{tip}} = x_t + l \cdot \sin(\theta_t)$ and $y_{\text{tip}} = l \cdot \cos(\theta_t)$ are the Cartesian coordinates of the pole tip
- $x_{\text{target}} = 0$ and $y_{\text{target}} = l$ are the target (upright) coordinates
- $\sigma_c$ is a parameter controlling the width of the cost function (default: 0.25)

This cost function is more focused on the pole tip position in Cartesian space rather than the angular position and cart position separately. It is based on the approach described in the [PILCO paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3104482.3104541) by Deisenroth & Rasmussen.

#### Custom Reward Function

As demonstrated in the example above, you can provide your own custom reward function to tailor the learning task to your specific needs. The custom reward function has the signature:

$$r_t = R(s_t, a_t, s_{t+1})$$

Where:
- $s_t = (x_t, \dot{x}_t, \theta_t, \dot{\theta}_t)$ is the state before the action
- $a_t$ is the action taken
- $s_{t+1} = (x_{t+1}, \dot{x}_{t+1}, \theta_{t+1}, \dot{\theta}_{t+1})$ is the resulting state after the action
- $r_t$ is the scalar reward value

This flexibility allows you to design complex reward shaping strategies, incorporate additional constraints, or experiment with different learning objectives.

**Note**: The custom reward function always receives the internal state representation $(x, \dot{x}, \theta, \dot{\theta})$ regardless of the observation space format configured with `obs_mode`. This means your reward calculations always work with the actual physical state variables rather than their transformed representations.

### System Dynamics

The system dynamics follow the standard cart-pole physics model. The state update equations are:

$$\ddot{x} = \frac{-2m_p l \dot{\theta}^2 \sin(\theta) + 3m_p g \sin(\theta)\cos(\theta) + 4F - 4b\dot{x}}{4(m_c + m_p) - 3m_p \cos^2(\theta)}$$

$$\ddot{\theta} = \frac{-3m_p l \dot{\theta}^2 \sin(\theta)\cos(\theta) + 6(m_c + m_p)g\sin(\theta) + 6(F - b\dot{x})\cos(\theta)}{4l(m_c + m_p) - 3m_p l \cos^2(\theta)}$$

Where:
- $m_c = 0.5$ (kg): Mass of the cart (default)
- $m_p = 0.5$ (kg): Mass of the pole (default)
- $l = 0.6$ (m): Length of the pole (default)
- $g = 9.82$ (m/s²): Gravitational acceleration (default)
- $b = 0.1$: Friction coefficient (default)
- $F$: Applied force, scaled from action value to range $[-10, 10]$ N

All of these parameters can be customized when creating the environment as shown in the example above.
