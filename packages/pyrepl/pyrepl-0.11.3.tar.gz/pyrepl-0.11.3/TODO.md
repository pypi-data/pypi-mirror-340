In no particular order:

- point-and-mark?
- user customization support (maybe even try to read `$INPUTRC`?)
- in general, implement more `readline` functions (just a matter of
  typing, for the most part)
- a more incremental way of updating the screen.
- undo support
- reduce verbosity
- tabs
- look up delete in `terminfo`? `tcsetattr(self.fd).cc[termios.VERASE]`
- mention license?
