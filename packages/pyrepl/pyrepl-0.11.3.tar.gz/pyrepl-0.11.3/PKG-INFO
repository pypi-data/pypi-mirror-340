Dynamic: summary


pyrepl is a Python library, inspired by readline, for building flexible
command line interfaces, featuring:
* sane multi-line editing
* history, with incremental search
* completion, including displaying of available options
* a fairly large subset of the readline emacs-mode keybindings
* a liberal, Python-style, license
* a new python top-level.
