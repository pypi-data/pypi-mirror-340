Correct the code, train the model, compute and print the evaluation metric, and save all model files
directly in the current directory with descriptive names.

Do not create any subdirectories. Use only {{allowed_packages}}. Do NOT use any
packages that are not part of this list of the Python standard library. Assume the training
data is in the following files in the current working directory {{training_data_files}}.

{% if use_validation_files %}
Assume the validation data is in the following files in the current working directory {{ validation_data_files }}.

IMPORTANT: the scrip MUST use the training datasets for training the model and the validation datasets for evaluating
the model performance. DO NOT mix these datasets during training.
    1. Load training data from the training_data_files
    2. Load validation data from the validation_data_files
    3. Train your model using ONLY the training data
    4. Evaluate your model using ONLY the validation data
    5. Report performance metrics calculated on the validation data
