edX Event Bus - Kafka
#####################

Kafka implementation for Open edX event bus.

|pypi-badge| |ci-badge| |codecov-badge| |doc-badge| |pyversions-badge|
|license-badge|

Overview
********
This package implements an event bus for Open edX using Kafka.

The event bus acts as a broker between services publishing events and other services that consume these events.
Implementing the event bus will allow for asynchronous messaging across services which greatly improves efficiency as we don't have to wait for scheduled batch synchronizations.
Additionally, since the services all speak to the event bus, they are independent of one another and can still function if one service crashes.

This package contains both the publishing code, which processes events into messages to send to the broker, and the consumer code,
which polls the broker using a `while True` loop in order to turn messages back into event data to be emitted.
The actual Kafka host will be configurable.

The goal for event-bus-kafka is to eventually have a flexible event bus that can be easily brought into other apps and repositories to produce and consume arbitrary topics.
Ideally, the event bus itself will also be an abstraction behind which platform maintainers can use non-Kafka implementations (Redis, Pulsar, etc.).
The documentation/ADRs may also be moved to more appropriate places as the process matures.

The repository works together with the openedx/openedx-events repository to make the fully functional event bus.

Documentation
*************

To use this implementation of the Event Bus with openedx-events, you'll need to ensure that you include the dependency ``confluent_kafka[avro,schema-registry]`` (see `ADR 5 <https://github.com/openedx/event-bus-kafka/blob/main/docs/decisions/0005-optional-import-of-confluent-kafka.rst>`_ for an explanation) and set the following Django settings::

    EVENT_BUS_KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS: ...
    EVENT_BUS_KAFKA_SCHEMA_REGISTRY_URL: ...
    EVENT_BUS_TOPIC_PREFIX: ...

    # On the producing side:
    EVENT_BUS_PRODUCER: edx_event_bus_kafka.create_producer

    # On the consuming side:
    EVENT_BUS_CONSUMER: edx_event_bus_kafka.KafkaEventConsumer


Optional settings that are worth considering:

- ``EVENT_BUS_KAFKA_CONSUMER_CONSECUTIVE_ERRORS_LIMIT``

For manual testing, see `<docs/how_tos/manual_testing.rst>`__.

Django management commands:

- If you need to test event production, use the ``produce_event`` management command
- To actually run the consumer, use openedx-events' ``consume_events`` management command

[3.7.0] - 2023-01-30
********************
Changed
=======
* Added ``reset_offsets_and_sleep_indefinitely`` method to consumer; relying code should switch to calling this when an offset timestamp is set.
* Deprecated the ``offset_timestamp`` parameter on the consumer's ``consume_indefinitely`` method, since ``reset_offsets_and_sleep_indefinitely`` should be used instead.

[3.6.3] - 2023-01-27
********************
Fixed
=====
* In the consumer loop, open new database connection if the old one has closed before processing messages

[3.6.2] - 2023-01-26

Fixed
=====
* Reset mode now commits the correct offsets to Kafka.

[3.6.1] - 2023-01-20

[3.5.0] - 2023-01-05
********************
Added
=====
* New setting ``EVENT_BUS_KAFKA_CONSUMER_CONSECUTIVE_ERRORS_LIMIT`` will terminate the consumer if too many errors occur in a row, supporting an automated version of "have you tried turning it off and on again" (as long as consumer will automatically be restarted e.g. by Kubernetes).

********************
Changed
=======
* Added/removed some custom attributes used for monitoring. Search for custom_attribute_name annotations for details.

[3.2.0] - 2022-12-14
********************
Changed
=======
* Add timestamp parameter for consumer, allowing the starting offset for consuming to be overridden from the default.

[3.1.0] - 2022-12-07
********************

Added
=====
* A variety of custom attributes are now set for monitoring purposes. Search for custom_attribute_name annotations for details.

[2.1.0] - 2022-12-01
********************
Changed
=======
* Set CloudEvent headers on events using an optional event_metadata parameter

[2.0.0] - 2022-11-28
********************
Changed
=======
* Implement openedx-events Event Bus Producer API
* **BREAKING CHANGE**: Remove caching from ``get_producer`` and rename to ``create_producer``, as we now rely on the wrapper in openedx-events to cache that call

Upgrading library from 1.x:

- Replace calls to ``edx_event_bus_kafka.get_producer`` with ``openedx_events.event_bus.get_producer``
- Add Django setting ``EVENT_BUS_PRODUCER = "edx_event_bus_kafka.create_producer"``

These breaking changes are only relevant for the producing side. (This should only include the CMS at the moment.)

[1.10.0] - 2022-11-21
*********************
Changed
=======
* Improve receiver error log message -- mention that stack traces are elsewhere in log

[1.9.0] - 2022-11-15
********************
Changed
=======
* Log and record receiver errors the same way as other errors (with offset, partition, etc.)

[1.8.1] - 2022-11-10
********************
Changed
=======
* Commit consumer offset asynchronously

[1.8.0] - 2022-11-09
********************
Added
=====
* Consumer logs a warning for receivers that fail with an exception

[1.7.0] - 2022-11-04
********************

Changed
=======
* Manually manage commits instead of using auto-commit on the consumer
* Catch Exception instead of BaseException on both producer and consumer

[1.6.0] - 2022-11-04
********************

* Consumer loop will no longer exit when an error is encountered

[1.5.0] - 2022-11-01
********************

Changed
=======
* Log full event data on all producer errors

[1.4.3] - 2022-10-31
********************

Fixed
=====
* Upgrade openedx-events and fastavro to bring in a fix for schema creation

[1.4.2] - 2022-10-31
********************

* Removed proof-of-concept code that logged user-login events

[1.4.1] - 2022-10-28
********************

Fixed
=====
* Correct and clarify management command help strings (some copy-paste errors)
* Update TODO comments

[1.4.0] - 2022-10-21
********************

Changed
=======
* Remove override of auto.offset.reset on consumer (which will default to "latest"). New consumer groups will consume only messages that are sent after the group was initialized.
* Remove redundant lookup of signal in consumer loop (should not have any effect)
* Explicitly encode message header values as UTF-8 (no change in behavior)

[1.3.0] - 2022-10-20
********************

Changed
=======

* Upgrade openedx-events. When AvroSignalSerializer gets event schemas, it will get whatever is currently defined in openedx-events, so this will update the COURSE_CATALOG_EVENT_CHANGED schema (dropping `effort` field)

[1.2.0] - 2022-10-13
********************

Changed
=======

* ``EVENT_BUS_KAFKA_CONSUMERS_ENABLED`` now defaults to True instead of False
* Removed manual monitoring since New Relic tracks these now.

[1.1.0] - 2022-10-06
********************

Changed
=======

* Added monitoring for consumption tasks.

[1.0.0] - 2022-10-03
********************

Changed
=======

* Fixed bug in schema registry that was sending schemas to the wrong topic
* Bump version to 1.x to acknowledge that this is in use in production

[0.6.1] - 2022-09-06
********************

Added
=====

* Producer now polls on an interval, improving callback reliability. Configurable with ``EVENT_BUS_KAFKA_POLL_INTERVAL_SEC``.

[0.6.0] - 2022-09-01
********************

Changed
=======

* **Breaking change**: Public API is now defined in ``edx_event_bus_kafka`` package and ``edx_event_bus_kafka.management.commands`` package; all other modules should be considered unstable and not for external use.

[0.5.1] - 2022-08-31
********************

Fixed
=====

* Various lint issues (and missing ``__init__.py`` files.)

[0.5.0] - 2022-08-31
********************

Changed
=======

* **Breaking changes** in the producer module, refactored to expose a better API:

  * Rather than ``send_to_event_bus(...)``, relying code should now call ``get_producer().send(...)``.
  * The ``sync`` kwarg is gone; to flush and sync messages before shutdown, call ``get_producer().prepare_for_shutdown()`` instead.

* Clarify that config module is for internal use only.
* Implementation changes: Only a single Producer is created, and is used for all signals.

[0.4.4] - 2022-08-26
********************

Fixed
=====

* Fixed bug in test module for when confluent-kafka isn't present

[0.4.3] - 2022-08-24
********************

Fixed

[0.4.2] - 2022-08-24
********************

Fixed
=====

* Properly load auth settings for producer/consumer. (Auth settings were ignored since 0.3.1.)

[0.4.1] - 2022-08-18
********************

Changed
=======

* Remove confluent-kafka as a formal dependency of the repository.

  * Note: This library will not work without confluent-kafka.

* Add an ADR to explain why this work was done.

[0.4.0] - 2022-08-15
********************

Changed
=======

* Rename settings to have consistent prefix.

  * ``KAFKA_CONSUMERS_ENABLED`` becomes ``EVENT_BUS_KAFKA_CONSUMERS_ENABLED``
  * ``CONSUMER_POLL_TIMEOUT`` becomes ``EVENT_BUS_KAFKA_CONSUMER_POLL_TIMEOUT``
