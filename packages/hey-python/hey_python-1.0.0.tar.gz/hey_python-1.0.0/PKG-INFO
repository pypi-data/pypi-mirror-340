# Hey CLI

An AI-powered CLI assistant that helps with coding and system tasks.

## Installation

### From PyPI

```bash
pip install hey-cli
```

### From Source (for development)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kawai-Senpai/hey-cli.git
cd hey-cli/library
pip install -e .
```

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file in your working directory with your OpenAI API key:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
AI_MODEL=gpt-4o  # Optional, defaults to gpt-4o
AI_TEMPERATURE=0.1  # Optional, defaults to 0.1
```

## Usage

After installation, you can use the `hey` command followed by your question or instruction:

```bash
# Ask for help
hey help me understand how to use this tool

# Create a simple script
hey create a hello world script in python

# Get system information
hey what files do I have in this directory?

# Create files for a project
hey create a new React component for a login form
```

## Testing Locally

1. Install the package in development mode:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/hey-cli/library
   pip install -e .
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file in any directory where you want to use the tool:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_openai_key_here
   ```

3. Navigate to that directory and run commands:
   ```bash
   cd /your/project/directory
   hey create a simple python script that prints the current date
   ```
