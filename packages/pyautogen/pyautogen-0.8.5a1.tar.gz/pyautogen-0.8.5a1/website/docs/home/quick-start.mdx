AG2 (formerly AutoGen) is an open-source programming framework for building AI agents and facilitating their cooperation to solve tasks. AG2 supports tool use, autonomous and human-in-the-loop workflows, and multi-agent conversation patterns.

<Warning>
**From version 0.8**: The OpenAI package, `openai`, is not installed by default.

Install AG2 with your preferred model provider(s), for example:
- `pip install ag2[openai]`
- `pip install ag2[gemini]`
- `pip install ag2[anthropic,cohere,mistral]`

On Mac OS, if you get "no matches found:", add a quote to the package name, for example:
- `pip install "ag2[openai]"`
</Warning>

### Let's go

```sh
pip install ag2[openai]
```
<Tip>
If you have been using `autogen` or `pyautogen`, all you need to do is upgrade it using:
```bash
pip install -U autogen[openai]
```
or
```bash
pip install -U pyautogen[openai]
```
as `pyautogen`, `autogen`, and `ag2` are aliases for the same PyPI package.
