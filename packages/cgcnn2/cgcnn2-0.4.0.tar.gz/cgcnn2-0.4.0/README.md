As the original Crystal Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (CGCNN) repository is no longer actively maintained, this repository is a reproduction of [CGCNN](https://github.com/txie-93/cgcnn) by Xie et al. It includes necessary updates for deprecated components and a few additional functions to ensure smooth operation. Despite its age, CGCNN remains a straightforward and fast deep learning framework that is easy to learn and use.

The package provides following major functions:

- **Training** a CGCNN model with a customized dataset.
- **Predicting** material properties with a pre-trained CGCNN model.
- **Fine-tuning** a pre-trained CGCNN model on a new dataset.
- **Extracting** atomic features as descriptors for the downstream task.

## Installation

Make sure you have a Python interpreter, preferably version 3.10 or higher. Then, you can simply install cgcnn2 from
PyPI using `pip`:

```bash
pip install cgcnn2
```

If you'd like to use the latest unreleased version on the main branch, you can install it directly from GitHub:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/jcwang587/cgcnn2
```

## Get Started

```bash
cgcnn-ft --help
```
