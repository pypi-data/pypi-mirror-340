# python-esileapclient

Python API for interacting with [ESI-Leap](https://github.com/CCI-MOC/esi-leap)

### Overview

This is a client for the OpenStack Lease API. It provides:

   - a openstack command-line plugin: `openstack lease`

python-esileapclient is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0, like the rest of OpenStack.

### Installation

To install as a package:
```
# pip install python-esileapclient`
```

To install from source:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/CCI-MOC/python-esileapclient
$ cd python-esileapclient
# python setup.py install
```

### `openstack lease` CLI

The `openstack lease` command-line interface is available when the lease plugin (included in this package) is used with the [OpenStackClient](https://docs.openstack.org/python-openstackclient/latest/)

The client uses the OpenStack Identity API (Keystone) to authenticate users with an OpenStack cloud and to locate the lease service endpoint (see [here](https://docs.openstack.org/keystone/latest/admin/manage-services.html) for more info). Currently, overriding this endpoint is not supported. Credentials for authentication can be provided via command-line parameters (e.g. `--os-username, --os-password, etc.`) or by setting environment variables (e.g. `OS_USERNAME, OS_PASSWORD`).

Usage Examples:

    openstack esi offer list

will make a GET request to ESI-Leap and print to screen a list of all the offers in the ESI-Leap database.

    openstack esi offer show <uuid>

will make a GET request and print fields for offer with the given uuid.

    openstack esi offer create --resource-type dummy_node --resource-uuid 1718

will make a POST request to ESI-Leap to create the offer with the given credentials. Prints to the screen the newly created offer with resource type 'dummy\_node' and resource uuid '1718'.

    openstack esi offer delete <uuid>

will make a DELETE request to ESI-Leap to delete the request with the given uuid. Prints to the screen whether the command was a success or not.
