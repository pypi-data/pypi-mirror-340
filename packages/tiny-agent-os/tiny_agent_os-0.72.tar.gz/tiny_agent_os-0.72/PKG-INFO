### Installation

```bash
# Install via pip (recommended)
pip install tiny_agent_os

# Or for development, clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/alchemiststudiosai/tinyAgent.git

cd tinyagent

# Option 1: For Linux users, run the installation script
chmod +x install/linuxInstall.sh && ./install/linuxInstall.sh

# Option 2: Manual installation
# Create a virtual environment (recommended)
python3 -m venv .venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
# On Windows
.\.venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
# Option 1: Using UV (recommended - see INSTALL.md for details)
# Option 2: Using pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up required configuration files
# 1. Environment variables
cp .envexample .env
# Edit .env to add your API keys (especially OpenRouter)

# 2. Configuration file
cp exampleconfig.yml config.yml
# Edit config.yml to customize your settings
```

### Pip Installation

```bash
# Simple pip installation
pip install tiny_agent_os
```

---

### Post-Installation Configuration

After installing via pip, you **must** provide your own configuration files:

#### 1. Create `config.yml`

- Copy the example if available:

```bash
cp exampleconfig.yml config.yml
```

- Or create a new `config.yml` in your project directory with at least:

```yaml
base_url: "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1"
model:
  default: "deepseek/deepseek-chat"
# Add any other settings you need
```

#### 2. Create `.env`

- In your project directory, create a `.env` file:

```bash
touch .env
```

- Add your API key:

```
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

#### 3. (Optional) Override config locations

- You can set environment variables to override default paths:

```bash
export TINYAGENT_CONFIG=/path/to/your/config.yml
export TINYAGENT_ENV=/path/to/your/.env
```

**Note:** The orchestrator component is currently being built and is in beta.

## Philosophy

1. **Functions as Agents**
   - You can turn **any function** into a **tool** or **agent**.
   - This makes it easy to add new capabilities.

```mermaid

    A["Python Function"] --> B["Tool"]
    B --> C["Agent"]
    C --> D["Result"]
```

![Function to Agent Flow](static/images/func_agent.png)

```python
# Define a simple calculator function and turn it into a tool
@tool
def calculate_sum(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Calculate the sum of two integers."""
    return a + b

def main():
    """Create a basic agent with a calculator tool."""
    # One-liner: create agent with our tool directly
    agent = AgentFactory.get_instance().create_agent(tools=[calculate_sum])
    # Run the agent with a query
    query = "calculate the sum of 5 and 3"
    print(f"Running agent with query: '{query}'")
    # you can also specify the expected type of the result
    result = agent.run(query, expected_type=int)
    print(f"Result: {result}")
    print(f"Result Type: {type(result)}")
```

2. **Hierarchical Orchestration**
   - You can **combine many agents** together.
   - A **top-level agent** or **orchestrator** can **delegate tasks** to **specialized agents**.
   - This helps solve **complex problems** by breaking them into parts.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    O["Research Orchestrator"] --> A1["Web Search Agent"]
    O --> A2["Summarizer Agent"]
    O --> A3["Code Snippet Agent"]
```

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Orchestrator Beta Notice:**  
> The orchestrator component is **in early beta** and **may not work fully out of the box**.  
> You can **hack together your own tools and configs** to get it working for your needs,  
> but expect some rough edges and double-check everything.  
> Improvements are ongoing.

## Features

1. **Modular Design**

   - Tools are defined with `@tool` and easily integrated or swapped.

2. **Flexible Agent Options**

   - **Orchestrator**: Simple task execution.
   - **AgentFactory**: Fine-tuned control.
   - **DynamicAgentFactory**: Dynamic agent creation.

3. **Centralized Setup**

   - Factory pattern streamlines configuration and logging.

4. **Robust Error Handling**

   - Custom exceptions (e.g., `ToolError`) improve debugging.

5. **Clean Code Structure**

   - Agents handle logic; tools handle execution.

6. **Versatile Interaction**

   - Use `agent.execute_tool()` for precision or `agent.run()` for broader tasks.

7. **Structured Output**
   - Enforce JSON structure on LLM responses for consistent parsing
   - Enable with `output.structured: true` in config.yml
   - Compatible with OpenRouter's JSON schema validation

## Key Takeaways

- **tinyAgent** is perfect for scalable AI projects needing structured agent and tool management.
- It offers **extensibility**, **error handling**, and **logging**, but may be overkill for simple tasks.

_Important Note on Tools_:

The aider tool integrated in TinyAgent is extremely powerful but requires proper understanding to use effectively. It's highly configurable with many advanced features that can dramatically enhance productivity when used correctly.

**‚ö†Ô∏è We strongly recommend thoroughly learning aider before using it in any serious projects.**

Invest time in studying the documentation at https://aider.chat/ to understand its capabilities, configuration options, and best practices. This investment will pay off significantly in your development workflow.
