# MOC transports

Basic repository for reading AMOC transport data (volume transports only) from transport mooring arrays into a single format.

The **initial plan** for this repository is to simply load the volume transports as published by different AMOC observing arrays and replicate (update) the figure from Frajka-Williams et al. (2019) [10.3389/fmars.2019.00260](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2019.00260).
