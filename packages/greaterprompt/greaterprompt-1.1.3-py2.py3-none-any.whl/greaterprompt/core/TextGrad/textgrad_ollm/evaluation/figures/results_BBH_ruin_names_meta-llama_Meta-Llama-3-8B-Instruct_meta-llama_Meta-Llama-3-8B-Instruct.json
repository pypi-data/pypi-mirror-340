For instance, the name is a reference to the post-punk band Joy Division, which is known for its dark and introspective music. This context could provide additional layers of meaning and humor to the edit. Instead of solely relying on the antonymic relationship, explore other linguistic and semantic aspects that contribute to the humor. For example, the edit \"job division\" could be seen as a play on words, leveraging the common phrase \"job division\" (e.g., dividing tasks among employees) and subverting the expectation of a humorous edit. Consider providing more concrete evidence to support the claim that option A) job division is the most likely humorous edit. This could involve analyzing the linguistic and semantic features of the other options, highlighting why they are less humorous or less likely to be chosen. Finally, consider adding more nuance to the evaluation of the other options, providing more specific and detailed explanations for why they are less humorous."], "validation_acc": [[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], 0.71, 0.74, 0.74, 0.74, 0.76, 0.77, 0.77, 0.77, 0.77, 0.77, 0.78, 0.8]}
