Double-check your calculations and conclusions to ensure accuracy and avoid errors in your prediction. Use simple language and avoid jargon to ensure that your explanation is easy to follow. Use precise language and avoid approximations to ensure that your calculations and conclusions are accurate. Consider the context of the question and provide your answer in the format: 'Answer: $VALUE' where VALUE is a numerical value. Think critically about the problem, avoiding assumptions and biases. Avoid ambiguity and confusion by providing a clear explanation of your thought process and using precise language. The last line of your response should be of the following format: 'Answer: $VALUE' where VALUE is a numerical value."], "validation_acc": [[1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], 0.73, 0.75, 0.77, 0.77, 0.77, 0.77, 0.77, 0.77, 0.77, 0.77, 0.77, 0.77]}
