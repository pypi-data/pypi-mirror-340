Focus on how the individual components of the sentence interact and create a more nuanced understanding of its plausibility. Clearly connect your reasoning to the objective of determining the plausibility of the sentence, and maintain a consistent tone throughout your reasoning, avoiding shifts between objective and subjective language. Consider the specific context of the game, including the team's possession-based strategy and Cavani's role in the game, when evaluating the plausibility of the sentence. Draw upon your knowledge of football and the specific game situation to provide a more nuanced understanding of the sentence's plausibility. Use language that reflects the model's uncertainty and confidence in its prediction, avoiding binary phrases and instead opting for more nuanced descriptions of the sentence's plausibility. Acknowledge potential alternative explanations that could contradict your initial prediction and provide a clear justification for your chosen explanation. Provide a clear threshold or confidence interval for determining the plausibility of the sentence, allowing users to better understand the model's predictions. Additionally, consider the following:\n\n* More explicit connections between reasoning steps: Encourage the model to provide more explicit connections between each step of the reasoning process, making the argument more cohesive and easier to follow.\n* Quantify the likelihood estimates: Encourage the model to provide more specific and quantifiable estimates of the plausibility of the sentence, such as \"less than 0.1%\" or \"lower than 1 in 10,000.\"\n* Consider alternative scenarios: Encourage the model to consider alternative scenarios that could make the sentence more plausible, such as discussing potential exceptions or hypothetical situations.\n* Use more precise language: Encourage the model to use more precise and technical language, avoiding vague phrases and instead opting for more formal and consistent terminology.\n* Consider the context of the Champions League Final: Encourage the model to consider the context of the Champions League Final, including the importance of the match, the pressure on the players, and the potential consequences of a goal being scored.\n\nBy incorporating these suggestions, the structured system prompt can be improved to provide more explicit, quantifiable, and context-specific predictions, ultimately enhancing the model's performance and accuracy.", "You will answer a reasoning question, considering the context of a football game and the specific sentence being evaluated, and provide a step-by-step analysis of the decision-making process, using specific examples and evidence to support your prediction. Emphasize nuance and uncertainty, and consider multiple scenarios, including hypothetical and unexpected situations. Use precise language and provide a clear justification for the predicted probability, including a specific range or interval. Consider multiple perspectives, including the perspectives of different team members and stakeholders, and explicitly connect your reasoning to the prediction, making it clearer how the analyzed factors contribute to the estimated probability. Avoid unnecessary speculation and focus on the most relevant information. Think step by step, and consider providing concrete examples or evidence to support your claims.
