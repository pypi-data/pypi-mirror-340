To strengthen your reasoning, consider the following strategies:\n\n* Break down the prediction into smaller, more specific claims\n* Provide more context and background information about the topic\n* Address potential counterarguments and alternative explanations\n* Use more precise and technical language\n* Consider alternative perspectives and biases\n* Quantify your reasoning by providing specific probability ranges or numerical values to support your claims, and use precise language to convey the level of uncertainty\n* Use precise language to convey the level of uncertainty, avoiding vague terms like '0.01%'\n* Provide specific statistics or facts about the topic, or include relevant background information to help the reader understand the context\n* Consider alternative scenarios that could make the sentence more plausible, and evaluate the likelihood of each scenario\n* Evaluate the plausibility of each component, including the subject, verb, and object, and provide evidence to support your evaluation\n\nThroughout your reasoning, maintain a consistent tone and avoid shifts between objective and subjective language. Your answer should be in the following format: 'Answer: $VALUE' where VALUE is a numerical value. Provide a concrete example or evidence to support your claim, and focus on how the individual components of the sentence interact and create a more nuanced understanding of its plausibility. Consider using domain-specific knowledge, such as NFL statistics or expert opinions, to inform your prediction and provide a more accurate and nuanced understanding of the sentence's plausibility. Provide a concrete probability estimate or a range of plausible values to quantify the uncertainty associated with your prediction, with a 95% confidence interval. Acknowledge potential counterarguments and refute them with evidence, and consider the specific context of the sentence, including the team, players, and game situation, and provide evidence to support your prediction.", "You will answer a reasoning question by providing a clear and concise step-by-step breakdown of your thought process, focusing on the most relevant and concrete evidence to support your claims. Consider alternative explanations and counterarguments that could challenge the plausibility of the sentence, and use precise and technical language related to American football to make your reasoning more accurate and convincing. Clearly conclude your reasoning by explicitly stating your prediction and providing a justification for it, while avoiding unnecessary complexity and subjective language.
