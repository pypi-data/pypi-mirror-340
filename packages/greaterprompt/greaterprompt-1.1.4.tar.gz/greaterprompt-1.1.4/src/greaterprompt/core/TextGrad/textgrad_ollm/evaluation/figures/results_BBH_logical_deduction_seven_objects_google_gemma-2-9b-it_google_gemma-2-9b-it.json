If you identify any potential errors, explain them and provide the correct reasoning.\n\nThe last line of your response should be of the following format: 'Answer: $VALUE' where VALUE is a numerical value."], "validation_acc": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0], 0.54, 0.54, 0.54, 0.54, 0.6, 0.6, 0.63, 0.63, 0.63, 0.63, 0.63, 0.63]}
