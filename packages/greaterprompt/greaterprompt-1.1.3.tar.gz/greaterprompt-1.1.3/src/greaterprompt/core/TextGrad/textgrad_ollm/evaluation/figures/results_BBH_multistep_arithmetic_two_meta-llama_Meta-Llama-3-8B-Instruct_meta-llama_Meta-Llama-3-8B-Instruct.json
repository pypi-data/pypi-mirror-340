Additionally, consider the following strategies:\n\n* Emphasize the importance of accuracy: Highlight the significance of providing accurate calculations and predictions, and encourage the language model to double-check its work to avoid mistakes.\n* Encourage explicit step-by-step evaluation: Specify that the language model should provide explicit step-by-step calculations, rather than vague phrases, to ensure clarity and transparency in its reasoning.\n* Highlight the value of alternative solutions: Emphasize the importance of considering alternative approaches or explanations for solving the problem, and encourage the language model to provide a clear justification for its chosen method.\n* Use more descriptive variable names: Suggest using more descriptive variable names to help the language model clearly identify and explain its calculations, making it easier for users to understand the reasoning behind its predictions.\n* Provide a clear format for the answer: Specify that the answer should be in the format 'Answer: $VALUE' where VALUE is a numerical value, and encourage the language model to provide a clear and concise explanation of its calculation leading to the final answer.\n* Consider adding intermediate calculations: Suggest including intermediate calculations to demonstrate the language model's thought process and provide additional clarity.\n* Use more descriptive language for the calculation: Encourage the language model to use more descriptive language to explain the calculation, such as \"The product of (-16) and (-61) is calculated by multiplying the two numbers, resulting in a final answer of 976.\"\n* Consider adding a brief explanation of the calculation: Suggest including a brief explanation of the calculation to provide context and clarity, such as \"The calculation involves multiplying two negative numbers, which results in a positive answer due to the change in sign.\"\n* Emphasize the importance of explicit step-by-step breakdown: Consider adding a strategy that encourages the language model to provide a more explicit and detailed step-by-step breakdown of its reasoning, highlighting the importance of following the order of operations (PEMDAS) and explicitly stating the intermediate calculations.\n* Encourage concise and clear language: Suggest that the language model use more concise and clear language to convey its reasoning, avoiding verbosity and jargon-heavy terms.\n* Highlight the value of key calculations: Emphasize the importance of highlighting key calculations and intermediate results, rather than simply stating the final answer.\n* Incorporate visual aids or diagrams: Consider adding a strategy that encourages the language model to incorporate visual aids or diagrams to illustrate complex calculations and make its reasoning more transparent.\n* Use a friendly and approachable tone: Suggest that the language model maintain a friendly and approachable tone when providing its reasoning, avoiding technical jargon and complex language.\n\nBy incorporating these strategies, the language model's reasoning and prediction will become more explicit, concise, clear, and effective, ultimately improving the objective function."], "validation_acc": [[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0], 0.49, 0.49, 0.49, 0.49, 0.49, 0.49, 0.57, 0.57, 0.59, 0.59, 0.59, 0.59]}
