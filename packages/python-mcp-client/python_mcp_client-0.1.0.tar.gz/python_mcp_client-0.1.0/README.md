## üöÄ Key Features

- **MCP Tool Orchestration**: Build and connect powerful LLM tools using standardized messaging protocols
- **Flask Web Interface**: Interact with AI agents through an intuitive, user-friendly dashboard
- **LangChain & LangGraph Integration**: Create sophisticated AI workflows with industry-standard frameworks
- **Multi-Server Support**: Connect to multiple tool servers simultaneously from a single interface
- **Dynamic Server Management**: Add, configure, and update tool servers at runtime without restarts

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

1. **Flask Web Application**: Modern web interface serving as the command center for your AI tools
2. **MultiServerMCPClient**: Advanced client that orchestrates connections to multiple tool servers
3. **LangChain React Agent**: Intelligent decision-making system that chooses the right tools for each task
4. **MCP Servers**: Specialized microservices that expose domain-specific tools through a standardized protocol

## üîß Getting Started with Python MCP

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kernelmax/python-mcp-client.git
   cd python-mcp-client
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set environment variables:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
   ```

### Running Your AI Tool Platform

1. Start the Flask application:
   ```bash
   python flask_app.py
   ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5008`

## üí° Natural Language AI Tool Examples

### Database Management with Natural Language

```python
# Example natural language query
"Show me all users in the database that registered in the last month"

# How the AI agent processes your request
# 1. The LLM agent interprets the natural language query
# 2. It selects the appropriate database tool
# 3. It generates and executes optimized SQL: "SELECT * FROM users WHERE registration_date >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 1 MONTH)"
# 4. Results are returned in a human-readable format
```

### Database Creation Through Conversation

```python
# Example natural language command
"Create a new database called customer_analytics"

# How the AI agent executes your request
# 1. The LLM agent processes your instructions
# 2. It selects the database creation tool
# 3. It executes the appropriate command with error handling
# 4. Confirmation is provided with next steps
```

### Intelligent File Operations

```python
# Example natural language request
"List all Python files in the current directory"

# How the AI assistant helps you
# 1. The LLM agent processes your request
# 2. It selects the file system tools
# 3. It intelligently filters results for Python files
# 4. Results are displayed in an organized format
```
