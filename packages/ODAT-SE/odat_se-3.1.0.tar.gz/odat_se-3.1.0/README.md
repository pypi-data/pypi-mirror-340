# ODAT-SE -- an open framework for data analysis

[Open Data Analysis Tool for Science and Engineering (ODAT-SE)](https://github.com/issp-center-dev/ODAT-SE) is a framework for applying a search algorithm to a direct problem solver to find the optimal solution. It has been developed by the name 2DMAT, and since version 3.0, it is organized as an open platform for data analysis by modularizing direct problem solvers and search algorithms.

As the standard direct problem solver, the experimental data analysis software for two-dimensional material structure analysis is prepared.
The direct problem solver gives the deviation between the experimental data and the calculated data obtained under the given parameters such as atomic positions as a loss function used in the inverse problem.
The optimal parameters are estimated by minimizing the loss function using a search algorithm.
For further use, the original direct problem solver or the search algorithm can be defined by users.
ODAT-SE offers wrappers of direct problem solvers for some of quantum beam diffraction experiments such as the total-reflection high-energy positron diffraction (TRHEPD) experiment.
As algorithms, it offers some minimizers such as the Nelder-Mead method and some samplers such as the population annealing Monte Carlo method.

In the future, we plan to add other direct problem solvers and search algorithms in ODAT-SE.

## odat-se

`odat-se` is a python framework library for solving inverse problems.
It also offers a driver script to solve the problem with predefined optimization algorithms and direct problem solvers. (`odat-se` also stands for the name of the script.)

### Prerequists

- Required
  - python >= 3.9
  - numpy >= 1.14
  - tomli >= 1.2.0
- Optional
  - scipy
    - for `minsearch` algorithm
  - mpi4py
    - for `exchange` algorithm
  - physbo >= 2.0
    - for `bayes` algorithm

### Install

- From PyPI (Recommended)
  - `python3 -m pip install -U ODAT-SE`
    - If you install them locally, use `--user` option like `python3 -m pip install -U --user`
- From Source (For developers)
  1. update `pip >= 19` by `python3 -m pip install -U pip`
  2. `python3 -m pip install ODAT_SE_ROOT_DIRECTORY` to install `odatse` package and `odat-se` command
      - `ODAT_SE_ROOT_DIRECTORY` means the directory including this `README.md` file.

### Simple Usage

- `odatse input.toml` (use the installed script)
- `python3 src/odatse_main.py input.toml` (use the raw script)
- For details of the input file, see the document.
