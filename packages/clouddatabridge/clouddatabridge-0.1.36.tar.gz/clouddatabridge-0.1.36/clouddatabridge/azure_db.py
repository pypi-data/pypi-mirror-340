        host (str): The server name or host or IP address of the Azure MySQL Database.
        database (str): The name of the database to connect to.
        user (str): The username for authentication.
        password (str): The password for authentication.
        port (int): The port number for the connection (default is 3306).
        db_connection: The database connection object (initially None).
