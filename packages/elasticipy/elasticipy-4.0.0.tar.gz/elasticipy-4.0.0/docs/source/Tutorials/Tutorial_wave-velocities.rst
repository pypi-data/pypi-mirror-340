Computing wave velocities
=========================

In this tutorial, we will see how one can compute the wave velocities in an (an)isotropic material, given its stiffness
tensor and its mass density.

Creating the *p*- and *s*-wave velocity functions
-------------------------------------------------
We will try to replicate the great tutorial made for MTEX user available `here <https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/WaveVelocities.html>`_.
We thus start by defining the stiffness tensor for forsterite:

.. doctest::

    >>> from Elasticipy.tensors.elasticity import StiffnessTensor
    >>> C = StiffnessTensor.orthorhombic(phase_name='forsterite',
    ...                                  C11=320, C12=68.2, C13=71.6, C22=196.5, C23=76.8,
    ...                                  C33=233.5, C44=64, C55=77, C66=78.7)
    >>> print(C)
    Stiffness tensor (in Voigt mapping):
    [[320.   68.2  71.6   0.    0.    0. ]
     [ 68.2 196.5  76.8   0.    0.    0. ]
     [ 71.6  76.8 233.5   0.    0.    0. ]
     [  0.    0.    0.   64.    0.    0. ]
     [  0.    0.    0.    0.   77.    0. ]
     [  0.    0.    0.    0.    0.   78.7]]
    Phase: forsterite
    Symmetry: orthorhombic

And define the mass density:

    >>> rho = 3.36

.. note::

    You should be careful about the unit you use. Since our stiffness is given in GPa, we have to use ``rho`` in kg/dm³
    in order to get the velocities in km/s. Look at `the full documentation <../Elasticipy.FourthOrderTensor.html#Elasticipy.FourthOrderTensor.StiffnessTensor.wave_velocity>`_ for details.

Now, we can define 3 spherical functions, which correspond to velocities of:

1. the compressive wave (a.k.a the *primary* wave);

2. the fast shear wave (a.k.a. the fast *secondary* wave);

3. the slow shear wave (a.k.a. the slow *secondary* wave);


    >>> cp, cs_fast, cs_slow = C.wave_velocity(rho)

One can check that for a given direction (say, **x**), the velocities are arranged in the right order:

    >>> x = [1, 0, 0]
    >>> print(cp.eval(x), cs_fast.eval(x), cs_slow.eval(x))
    9.759000729485331 4.839692040576451 4.7871355387816905

Plotting the wave velocities
----------------------------
Now, we can plot all the velocities on three independent pole figures:

>>> fig, _ = cp.plot_as_pole_figure(subplot_args=(131,), title='p wave', show=False)
>>> cs_fast.plot_as_pole_figure(subplot_args=(132,), title='s wave (fast)', fig=fig, show=False) # doctest: +SKIP
>>> cs_slow.plot_as_pole_figure(subplot_args=(133,), title='s wave (slow)', fig=fig, show=True)  # doctest: +SKIP

.. note::

    We pass ``subplot_args`` to create the subplots. The option ``show=false`` temporary disables showing the figure;
    this is necessary here to be plot multiple figures at once.
