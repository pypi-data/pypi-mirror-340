Plasticity
----------
Although Elasticipy was not initially meant to work on plasticity (hence the name...), it provides some clues about
simulations of elasto-plastic behaviour of materials. This tutorial shows how one can simulate a tensile test in the
elasto-plastic domain of a material.

The Johnson-Cook model
======================
The Johnson-Cook (JC) model is widely used in the literature for modeling isotropic hardening of metalic materials.
Therefore, it is available out-of-the-box in Elasticipy. It assumes that the flow stress (:math:`\sigma`) depends on the
equivalent strain (:math:`\varepsilon`), the strain rate (:math:`\dot{\varepsilon}`) and the temperature (:math:`T`),
according to the following equation:

.. math::

        \sigma = \left(A + B\varepsilon^n\right)
                \left[1 + C\log\left(\frac{\varepsilon}{\dot{\varepsilon}_0}\right)\right]
                \left(1-\theta^m\right)

with

.. math::

        \theta = \begin{cases}
                    \frac{T-T_0}{T_m-T_0} & \text{if } T<T_m\\\\
                    1                      & \text{otherwise}
                    \end{cases}


:math:`A`, :math:`B`, :math:`C`, :math:`\dot{\varepsilon}_0`, :math:`T_0`, :math:`T_m` and :math:`m` are parameters
whose values depend on the material.

Simulation of a stress-controlled tensile test
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
At first, we will try to simulate a stress-controlled tensile test. Although this approach is quite uncommon, we will do
this anyway, just because it is easier to program.

First, let us create the model:

.. doctest::

    >>> from Elasticipy.plasticity import JohnsonCook
    >>> JC = JohnsonCook(A=363, B=792.7122, n=0.5756)

The parameters are taken from [1]_. As we will also take elastic behaviour into account, we also need:

    >>> from Elasticipy.tensors.elasticity import StiffnessTensor
    >>> C = StiffnessTensor.isotropic(E=210000, nu=0.27)

Now, let say that we want to investigate the material's response for the tensile stress ranging from 0 to 725 MPa:

    >>> from Elasticipy.tensors.stress_strain import StressTensor, StrainTensor
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> n_step = 100
    >>> stress_mag = np.linspace(0, 725, n_step)
    >>> stress = StressTensor.tensile([1,0,0], stress_mag)

At least, we can directly compute the elastic strain for each step:

    >>> elastic_strain = C.inv() * stress

So now, the plastic strain can be computed using an iterative approach:

    >>> plastic_strain = StrainTensor.zeros(n_step)
    >>> for i in range(1, n_step):
    ...       strain_increment = JC.compute_strain_increment(stress[i])
    ...       plastic_strain[i] = plastic_strain[i-1] + strain_increment

That's all. Finally, let us plot the applied stress as a function of the overall elongation:

    >>> from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
    >>> elong = elastic_strain.C[0,0]+plastic_strain.C[0,0]
    >>> fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    >>> ax.plot(elong, stress_mag, label='Stress-controlled') # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> ax.set_xlabel(r'$\varepsilon_{xx}$') # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> ax.set_ylabel('Tensile stress (MPa)') # doctest: +SKIP

Now, let say that we want to investigate the material's response for the tensile stress ranging from 0 to 725 MPa:

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> n_step = 100
    >>> stress_mag = np.linspace(0, 725, n_step)
    >>> stress = StressTensor.tensile([1,0,0], stress_mag)

At least, we can directly compute the elastic strain for each step:

    >>> elastic_strain = C.inv() * stress

So now, the plastic strain can be computed using an iterative approach:

    >>> plastic_strain = StrainTensor.zeros(n_step)
    >>> for i in range(1, n_step):
    ...       strain_increment = JC.compute_strain_increment(stress[i])
    ...       plastic_strain[i] = plastic_strain[i-1] + strain_increment

That's all. Finally, let us plot the applied stress as a function of the overall elongation:

    >>> from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
    >>> elong = elastic_strain.C[0,0]+plastic_strain.C[0,0]
    >>> fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    >>> ax.plot(elong, stress_mag, label='Stress-controlled') # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> ax.set_xlabel(r'$\varepsilon_{xx}$') # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> ax.set_ylabel('Tensile stress (MPa)') # doctest: +SKIP

Simulation of a strain-controlled tensile test
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The difficulty of simulating a strain-controlled tensile test is that, at a given step, one must identify both the
elastic and the plastic strain (if any) at once, while ensuring that the stress keeps uniaxial. Therefore, the hack is
to add a subroutine (optimization loop) to find the tensile stress so that the associated strain complies with the applied strain:

    >>> from scipy.optimize import minimize_scalar
    >>> JC.reset_strain() # Ensure that the previous hardening does not count
    >>> stress = StressTensor.zeros(n_step)
    >>> plastic_strain = StrainTensor.zeros(n_step)
    >>> JC.reset_strain()
    >>> for i in range(1, n_step):
    ...        def fun(tensile_stress):
    ...            trial_stress = StressTensor.tensile([1,0,0], tensile_stress)
    ...            trial_elastic_strain = C.inv() * trial_stress
    ...            trial_strain_increment = JC.compute_strain_increment(trial_stress, apply_strain=False)
    ...            trial_plastic_strain = plastic_strain[i - 1] + trial_strain_increment
    ...            trial_elongation =  trial_plastic_strain.C[0,0] +  trial_elastic_strain.C[0,0]
    ...            return (trial_elongation - elong[i])**2
    ...        s = minimize_scalar(fun)
    ...        stress.C[0,0][i] = s.x
    ...        strain_increment = JC.compute_strain_increment(stress[i])
    ...        plastic_strain[i] = plastic_strain[i-1] + strain_increment

Finally, let's plot the corresponding tensile curve ontop of that of the stress-controlled tensile test:

    >>> ax.plot(elong, stress.C[0,0], label='Strain-controlled', linestyle='dotted') # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> ax.legend() # doctest: +SKIP

Incremental loading
===================
Here, we have only considered monotonic loading, but we can also consider different loading path, such as incremental:

    >>> load_path = [np.linspace(0,0.1),
    ...              np.linspace(0.1,0.099),
    ...              np.linspace(0.099,0.2),
    ...              np.linspace(0.2,0.199),
    ...              np.linspace(0.199,0.3)]
    >>> elong = np.concatenate(load_path)
    >>> n_step = len(elong)

.. image:: images/Incremental.png

or cyclic:


    >>> load_path = [np.linspace(0,0.1),
    ...              np.linspace(0.1,-0.2),
    ...              np.linspace(-0.2,0.3),
    ...              np.linspace(0.3,-0.4)]
    >>> elong = np.concatenate(load_path)
    >>> n_step = len(elong)

.. image:: images/Cyclic.png

.. note::

    The figure above clearly evidences the isotropic hardening inherent to the JC model.


Complex loading path
====================
In the example above, we have only studied longitudinal stress/strain. Still, it is worth mentioning that other stress
states can be investigated (e.g. shear, multiaxial etc.) thanks to the
`normality rule <https://www.doitpoms.ac.uk/tlplib/granular_materials/normal.php>`_.

Tresca's plasticity criterion
=============================
Above, we have used the von Mises plasticity criterion (a.k.a J2 criterion). This can be switched to Tresca by passing
the plasticity criterion to the model constructor:

    >>> JC = JohnsonCook(A=363, B=792.7122, n=0.5756, criterion='Tresca')

For instance, one can highlight the difference between the J2 and Tresca plasticity in shear:

    >>> JC.reset_strain()
    >>> JC_tresca = JohnsonCook(A=363, B=792.7122, n=0.5756, criterion='Tresca')
    >>> stress_mag = np.linspace(0, 500, n_step)
    >>> stress = StressTensor.shear([1,0,0], [0,1,0],stress_mag)
    >>> models = (JC, JC_tresca)
    >>> labels = ('von Mises', 'Tresca')
    >>>
    >>> elastic_strain = C.inv() * stress
    >>> fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    >>> for j, model in enumerate(models):
        ... plastic_strain = StrainTensor.zeros(n_step)
        ... for i in range(1, n_step):
        ...     strain_increment = model.compute_strain_increment(stress[i])
        ...     plastic_strain[i] = plastic_strain[i-1] + strain_increment
        ... eps_xy = elastic_strain.C[0,1]+plastic_strain.C[0,1]
        ... ax.plot(eps_xy, stress_mag, label=labels[j])
    >>> ax.set_xlabel(r'$\varepsilon_{xy}$') # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> ax.set_ylabel('Shear stress (MPa)') # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> ax.legend() # doctest: +SKIP
