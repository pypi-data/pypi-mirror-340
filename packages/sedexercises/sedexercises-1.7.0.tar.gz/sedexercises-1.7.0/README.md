# Sed Exercises

This TUI application includes 50+ questions meant to be solved using `GNU sed`. Some exercises will require you to combine `sed` with other standard commands such as `tac`, `wc` and `tr`.

> **Note:** This application is intended to be run in a Linux-like environment. You might still be able to solve the exercises on other platforms, but I do not know if that'll work.
