# Git Auto Commit

## 📌 Introduction
Git Auto Commit is a tool that automatically commits modified files with a confirmation prompt. If no response is given within 2 minutes, the commit is executed automatically.

This tool is useful for developers who frequently modify files and want to ensure their changes are committed regularly without manual intervention.
