# Theoretical Background

This section provides the mathematical and physical foundations for the fatigue analysis methods implemented in FatPy.

## Approaches to Fatigue Analysis

FatPy implements several fundamental approaches to fatigue life prediction:

- [Stress Life](stress_life.md): Methods based on stress-based approaches
- [Strain Life](strain_life.md): Methods based on strain-based approaches
- [Energy Life](energy_life.md): Methods based on energy-based approaches

## Fundamental Concepts

*TO BE IMPLEMENTED*

## API Reference
