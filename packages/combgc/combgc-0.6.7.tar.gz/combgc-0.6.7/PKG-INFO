**comBGC** is a command-line tool that integrates, filters, and refines biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) predictions from **deepBGC, GECCO, and antiSMASH**. It ensures that only **high-quality, non-redundant BGCs** are included in the final dataset.

### Key Features
âœ… **Combines** results from multiple **BGC prediction tools**  
âœ… **Filters out** low-confidence BGCs, ensuring **high-quality output**  
âœ… **Merges** overlapping BGCs, keeping the **most comprehensive one**  
âœ… **Outputs a structured, non-redundant table** with key details
