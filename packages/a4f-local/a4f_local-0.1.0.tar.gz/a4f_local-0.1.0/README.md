# a4f-local

A unified, professional Python wrapper for various reverse-engineered AI provider APIs, designed to be **OpenAI-compatible** and **easy to use**.

---

## Key Features

- **Unified API:** Call multiple unofficial AI providers with a single, OpenAI-like interface.
- **Modular:** Easily extend with new providers and capabilities.
- **Supports Text-to-Speech (TTS):** Initial implementation includes OpenAI.fm reverse-engineered TTS.
- **OpenAI-Compatible:** Accepts and returns data in the same format as OpenAI's official API.
- **Simple to Use:** Designed for developers of all skill levels.

## Installation

First, **clone this repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Devs-Do-Code/a4f-local.git
cd a4f-local
```

Then, **install the package locally**:

```bash
pip install .
```

---

## Usage Example

```python
from a4f_local import A4F

client = A4F()

try:
    audio_bytes = client.audio.speech.create(
        model="tts-1",  # Model name (currently informational)
        input="Hello from a4f-local!",
        voice="alloy"   # Choose a supported voice
    )
    with open("output.mp3", "wb") as f:
        f.write(audio_bytes)
    print("Generated output.mp3")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

## Supported Voices

The following voice names are supported (mapped to OpenAI's official voices):

- `alloy`
- `echo`
- `fable`
- `onyx`
- `nova`
- `shimmer`

Use one of these as the `voice` parameter in your TTS requests.

## How It Works

- You interact with the `A4F` client **just like OpenAI's Python SDK**.
- The client **automatically discovers** available providers and their capabilities.
- When you call a method (e.g., `client.audio.speech.create()`), it **routes the request** to the appropriate provider.
- The provider **translates** the OpenAI-compatible request into its own API format, calls the API, and **translates the response back**.

---

## Roadmap

- **More Providers:** Support for chat, image generation, and other AI capabilities.
- **New Models:** If everything goes well, support for **OpenAI's latest and most advanced models** — `ash`, `coral`, and `sage` — will also be added.
- **PyPI Release:** This package will be published on PyPI soon. More detailed documentation and examples will be added at that time.
- **Configuration:** Easier ways to configure API keys and provider preferences.
- **Async Support:** Async versions of API calls.
- **Better Error Handling:** More informative error messages and exceptions.
