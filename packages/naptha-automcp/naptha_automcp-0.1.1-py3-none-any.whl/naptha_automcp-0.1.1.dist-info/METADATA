              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# automcp

## 🚀 Overview

automcp allows you to easily convert tools, agents and orchestrators from existing agent frameworks into [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) servers, that can then be accessed by standardized interfaces via clients like Cursor and Claude Desktop.

We currently support deployment of agents, tools, and orchestrators as MCP servers for the following agent frameworks:

1. CrewAI
2. LangGraph
3. Llama Index
4. OpenAI Agents SDK
5. Pydantic AI
6. mcp-agent

## 🔧 Installation

Install from PyPI:

```bash
# Basic installation
pip install naptha-automcp
```

Or install from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/napthaai/automcp.git
cd automcp
uv venv 
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```

## 🧩 Quick Start

Create a new MCP server for your project:

Navigate to your project directory with your agent implementation:

```bash
cd your-project-directory
```

Generate the MCP server files via CLI with one of the following flags (crewai, langgraph, llamaindex, openai, pydantic, mcp_agent):

```bash
automcp init -f crewai
```

Edit the generated `run_mcp.py` file to configure your agent:

```python
# Replace these imports with your actual agent classes
from your_module import YourCrewClass

# Define the input schema
class InputSchema(BaseModel):
    parameter1: str
    parameter2: str

# Set your agent details
name = "<YOUR_AGENT_NAME>"
description = "<YOUR_AGENT_DESCRIPTION>"

# For CrewAI projects
mcp_crewai = create_crewai_adapter(
    orchestrator_instance=YourCrewClass().crew(),
    name=name,
    description=description,
    input_schema=InputSchema,
)
```

Install dependencies and run your MCP server:

```bash
automcp serve -t sse
```

## 📁 Generated Files

When you run `automcp init -f <FRAMEWORK>`, the following file is generated:

### run_mcp.py

This is the main file that sets up and runs your MCP server. It contains:

- Server initialization code
- STDIO and SSE transport handlers
- A placeholder for your agent implementation
- Utilities to suppress warnings that might corrupt the STDIO protocol

You'll need to edit this file to:

- Import your agent/crew classes
- Define your input schema (the parameters your agent accepts)
- Configure the adapter with your agent


## 🔍 Examples

### Running the examples

The repository includes examples for each supported framework:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/NapthaAI/automcp.git
cd automcp

# Install automcp in development mode
pip install -e .

# Navigate to an example directory
cd examples/crewai/marketing_agents

# Generate the MCP server files (use the appropriate framework)
automcp init -f crewai

# Edit the generated run_mcp.py file to import and configure the example agent
# (See the specific example's README for details)

# Add a .env file with necessary environmental variables

# Install dependencies and run
automcp serve -t sse
```

Each example follows the same workflow as a regular project:

1. Run `automcp init -f <FRAMEWORK>` to generate the server files
2. Edit `run_mcp.py` to import and configure the example agent
3. Add a .env file with necessary environmental variables
4. Install dependencies and serve using `automcp serve -t sse`

### CrewAI example
Here's what a typical configured `run_mcp.py` looks like for a CrewAI example:

```python
import warnings
from typing import Any
from automcp.adapters.crewai import create_crewai_adapter
from pydantic import BaseModel
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("MCP Server")

warnings.filterwarnings("ignore")

from crew import MarketingPostsCrew

class InputSchema(BaseModel):
    project_description: str
    customer_domain: str

name = "marketing_posts_crew"
description = "A crew that posts marketing posts to a social media platform"

# Create an adapter for crewai
mcp_crewai = create_crewai_adapter(
    orchestrator_instance=MarketingPostsCrew().crew(),
    name=name,
    description=description,
    input_schema=InputSchema,
)
mcp.add_tool(
    mcp_crewai,
    name=name,
    description=description
)

# Server entrypoints
def serve_sse():
    mcp.run(transport="sse")

def serve_stdio():
    # Redirect stderr to suppress warnings that bypass the filters
    import os
    import sys

    class NullWriter:
        def write(self, *args, **kwargs):
            pass
        def flush(self, *args, **kwargs):
            pass

    # Save the original stderr
    original_stderr = sys.stderr

    # Replace stderr with our null writer to prevent warnings from corrupting STDIO
    sys.stderr = NullWriter()

    # Set environment variable to ignore Python warnings
    os.environ["PYTHONWARNINGS"] = "ignore"

    try:
        mcp.run(transport="stdio")
    finally:
        # Restore stderr for normal operation
        sys.stderr = original_stderr

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import sys
    if len(sys.argv) > 1 and sys.argv[1] == "sse":
        serve_sse()
    else:
        serve_stdio()
```

## 🔄 Running Your MCP Server

After setting up your files, you can run your server using one of these methods:

```bash
# Using the automcp CLI
automcp serve -t stdio    # STDIO transport
automcp serve -t sse      # SSE transport

# Or run the Python file directly
python run_mcp.py       # STDIO transport
python run_mcp.py sse   # SSE transport

# Or with uv run (if configured in pyproject.toml)
uv run serve_stdio
uv run serve_sse
```

**Note about transport modes:**
- **STDIO**: You don't need to run the server manually - it will be started by the client (Cursor)
- **SSE**: This is a two-step process:
  1. Start the server separately: `python run_mcp.py sse` or `automcp serve -t sse`
  2. Add the mcp.json configuration to connect to the running server

If you want to use the `uv run` commands, add the following to your `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[tool.uv.scripts]
serve_stdio = "python run_mcp.py"
serve_sse = "python run_mcp.py sse"
```

## 🔌 Using with MCP Clients

### Cursor

To integrate with Cursor IDE, create a `.cursor` folder in your project root and add an `mcp.json` file with the following configuration:

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "crew-name-stdio": {
            "type": "stdio",
            "command": "/absolute/path/to/your/.venv/bin/uv",
            "args": [
                "--directory",
                "/absolute/path/to/your/project_dir",
                "run",
                "serve_stdio"
            ],
            "env": {
                "OPENAI_API_KEY": "sk-",
                "SERPER_API_KEY": ""
            }
        },
        
        "crew-name-python": {
            "type": "stdio",
            "command": "/absolute/path/to/your/.venv/bin/python",

            ],
            "env": {
                "OPENAI_API_KEY": "sk-",
                "SERPER_API_KEY": ""
            }
        },
        
        "crew-name-automcp": {
            "type": "stdio",
            "command": "/absolute/path/to/your/.venv/bin/automcp",
            "args": [
                "serve",
                "-t",
                "stdio"
            ],
            "cwd": "/absolute/path/to/your/project_dir",
            "env": {
                "OPENAI_API_KEY": "sk-",
                "SERPER_API_KEY": ""

        },
        
        "crew-name-sse": {
            "type": "sse",
            "url": "http://localhost:8000/sse"
        }
    }
}
```

**Note:** Be sure to replace all placeholder paths with absolute paths to your actual files and directories.

## 🛠️ Creating New Adapters

Want to add support for a new agent framework? Here's how:

1. Create a new adapter file in automcp/adapters/ (or add to an existing framework file):

```python
# automcp/adapters/framework.py
import json
import contextlib
import io
from typing import Any, Callable, Type
from pydantic import BaseModel

def create_framework_adapter(
    agent_instance: Any,
    name: str,
    description: str,
    input_schema: Type[BaseModel],
) -> Callable:
    """Doc string for your function"""
    
    # Get the field names and types from the input schema
    schema_fields = input_schema.model_fields

    # Create the parameter string for the function signature
    params_str = ", ".join(
        f"{field_name}: {field_info.annotation.__name__}"
        for field_name, field_info in schema_fields.items()
    )

    # Create the function body that constructs the input schema
    # Note: You may need to adjust the method calls (kickoff, model_dump_json)
    # to match your framework's specific API
    body_str = f"""def run_agent({params_str}):
        inputs = input_schema({', '.join(f'{name}={name}' for name in schema_fields)})
        with contextlib.redirect_stdout(io.StringIO()):
            result = agent_instance.framework_specific_run(inputs=inputs.model_dump())
        return result.framework_specific_result()
    """

    # Create a namespace for the function
    namespace = {
        "input_schema": input_schema,
        "agent_instance": agent_instance,
        "json": json,
        "contextlib": contextlib,
        "io": io,
    }

    # Execute the function definition in the namespace
    exec(body_str, namespace)

    # Get the created function
    run_agent = namespace["run_agent"]

    # Add proper function metadata
    run_agent.__name__ = name
    run_agent.__doc__ = description

    return run_agent
```

2. Create an example in examples/your_framework/

## 📝 Notes

- When working with STDIO transport, be careful with print statements in your agent code as they can corrupt the protocol
- The MCP Inspector can be used for debugging: `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector`
- Remember that for STDIO mode, the client (like Cursor) will start the server for you
- For SSE mode, you need to manually start the server and then configure the client to connect to it
