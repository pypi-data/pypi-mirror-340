This package contains the functions to process and analyze nondestructive ultrasound tests. Among these codes are tools for reading inspection files from various sources, data preprocessing algorithms, image reconstruction algorithms, and codes for presenting results.
The primary function of each module is described below:
 - `framework.data_types`: contains classes that define data structures other modules use in the mini-auspex package. Data structures store inspection data (such as inspection, part, and transducer parameters), generate regions of interest (ROI), and store results from imaging algorithms.
 - `framework.file_civa`: dedicated to reading CIVA simulator files.
 - `framework.file_m2k`: responsible for reading files that have the .m2k extension. Currently, the module can read files generated by inspections with Multix++ and Panther equipment.
 - `framework.pre_proc`: the algorithms implemented to perform the preprocessing on the inspection data.
 - `framework.post_proc`: functions that apply postprocessing operations to the results provided by image reconstruction algorithms.
 - `imaging.bscan`: implements the B-Scan image reconstruction algorithm.
 - `imaging.saft`: implements the SAFT image reconstruction algorithm.
 - `imaging.tfm`: implements the TFM image reconstruction algorithm.
 - `imaging.cpwc`: implements the CPWC  image reconstruction algorithm.
 - `surface.surface`: implements the module class that identifies the external surface of an object inspected by the immersion technique and also provides propagation times for a set of transducer elements and region of interest (ROI) points.
 - `surface.nonlinearopt`: implements auxiliary functions necessary for surface estimation by the surface class.
 - `parameter_estimation.intsurf_estimation`: algorithms for estimating underwater pipes' internal surface to evaluate these pipes' internal corrosion.
 - `parameter_estimation.cl_estimators`: algorithms for estimating the propagation speed of ultrasonic waves within water.
