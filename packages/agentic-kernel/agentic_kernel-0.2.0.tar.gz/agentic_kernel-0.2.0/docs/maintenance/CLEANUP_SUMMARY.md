# Codebase Cleanup Summary

## Actions Completed

1. **Removed Unnecessary Python Cache**
   - Cleaned up `__pycache__` directories throughout the codebase
   - Removed `.pytest_cache` directory

2. **Cleaned Up Virtual Environments**
   - Removed duplicate virtual environments (`.venv_test`, `.venv_new`)
   - Kept only the main `.venv` environment

3. **Created Maintenance Tools**
   - Added `cleanup.py` for Python cache cleanup
   - Added `check_duplicates.py` for finding potential duplicate files
   - Created `maintain.sh` as a comprehensive maintenance script

4. **Updated Documentation**
   - Added maintenance section to README.md
   - Updated tasks.md to reflect cleanup progress
   - Created `.cursor/rules/maintenance.rules.mdc` with cleanup guidelines

5. **Removed Duplicate Files**
   - Deleted redundant `chainlit.md` from the root directory

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Fix Import Issues**
   - Tests are currently failing due to import issues
   - Some imports are still using `src.agenticfleet` instead of `agentic_kernel`
   - Several imports are missing dependencies (`psutil`, `responses`, etc.)
   - The base agent implementation has `AgentConfig` but is missing `Agent` class that is imported by other modules

2. **Further Duplicate Cleanup**
   - Review and potentially consolidate duplicate files identified by `./maintain.sh duplicates`
   - Focus on consolidating duplicated code in base classes and agent implementations

3. **Code Organization**
   - Move application-specific code to the examples directory
   - Ensure the main Chainlit app is fully contained in examples/chainlit_app
   - Consider moving app.py to examples if it's only used for demos

4. **Package Structure**
   - Review the `src/agentic_kernel` structure and ensure it follows Python package best practices
   - Move any direct imports from the project root to their proper module locations

5. **Documentation Updates**
   - Update documentation to reflect the new structure
   - Ensure all architecture diagrams are accurate

6. **Tests Organization**
   - Organize tests to match the package structure
   - Consider adding test coverage reporting

## Duplicated Files That May Require Attention

The following key duplicates were identified and may need consolidation:

1. Multiple app.py files:
   - app.py (root)
   - examples/chainlit_app/app.py
   - examples/chainlit_app/src/agentic_kernel_demo/app.py

2. Base class files with potential duplication:
   - src/agentic_kernel/agents/base.py
   - src/agentic_kernel/agents/sandbox/base.py
   - src/agentic_kernel/ledgers/base.py
   - src/agentic_kernel/orchestration/base.py

3. Duplicated agent/plugin implementations:
   - src/agentic_kernel/agents/file_surfer.py and src/agentic_kernel/plugins/file_surfer.py
   - src/agentic_kernel/agents/web_surfer.py and src/agentic_kernel/plugins/web_surfer.py

4. Configuration files:
   - Multiple pyproject.toml files across examples and main directory

## Import Issues That Need Attention

The following import issues were identified after running tests:

1. **Module Path Changes**:
   - Some tests still import from `src.agenticfleet` instead of `agentic_kernel`
   - Need to update imports in all test files to use the new module structure

2. **Missing Dependencies**:
   - `psutil` is imported but not found (needed for OrchestratorAgent)
   - `responses` is imported but not found (needed for web_surfer tests)
   - These packages may need to be installed in the virtual environment

3. **Base Class Issues**:
   - Several agent implementations try to import `Agent` from `agentic_kernel.agents.base`
   - The base.py file may need to be updated to properly export this class
   - Agent implementations need to be consistent in how they import base classes

4. **Renamed Classes**:
   - `TaskEntry` and other classes appear to have been renamed or moved
   - Need to update imports to reflect the current structure

These issues suggest that the recent refactoring from `agenticfleet` to `agentic_kernel` may not be complete across all files, particularly in the test suite.

## Conclusion

The codebase is now cleaner and better organized, with tools in place to maintain its cleanliness. Further consolidation of duplicated code and streamlining of the package structure will help make the codebase more maintainable and easier to understand for new contributors.
