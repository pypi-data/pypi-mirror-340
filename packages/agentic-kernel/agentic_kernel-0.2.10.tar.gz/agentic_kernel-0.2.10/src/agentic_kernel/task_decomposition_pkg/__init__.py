"""Task decomposition system for breaking complex tasks into subtasks.

This package provides a system for decomposing complex tasks into smaller,
more manageable subtasks. It enables agents to break down complex problems,
manage dependencies between subtasks, and coordinate their execution.

Key components:
1. Task representation (ComplexTask, SubTask)
2. Decomposition strategies
3. Task decomposer for managing the decomposition process
