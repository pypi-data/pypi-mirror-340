# Workflow Optimizer

The Workflow Optimizer is a component of the Agentic Kernel orchestration system that analyzes workflow execution history and applies optimization strategies to improve performance, success rates, and resource utilization.

## Overview

The Workflow Optimizer examines past workflow executions to identify performance bottlenecks, inefficient agent selections, and resource utilization issues. It then applies various optimization strategies to create improved versions of workflows that can be executed more efficiently.

## Key Components

### WorkflowOptimizer

The main coordinator class that manages and applies multiple optimization strategies. It provides methods to:

- Optimize workflows based on execution history
- Generate optimization summaries
- Add/remove optimization strategies
- Compare original and optimized workflow versions

### Optimization Strategies

The system implements several optimization strategies:

#### 1. ParallelizationOptimizer

Identifies steps that can be executed in parallel by analyzing dependencies between steps. This strategy:
- Builds a dependency graph of workflow steps
- Calculates dependency depths
- Identifies steps at the same depth that don't conflict
- Marks compatible steps for parallel execution

#### 2. AgentSelectionOptimizer

Analyzes past executions to determine which agents performed best for similar tasks. This strategy:
- Tracks agent performance metrics (success rates, execution times)
- Identifies patterns of agent effectiveness for specific tasks
- Recommends agent reassignments based on historical performance

#### 3. ResourceOptimizer

Optimizes resource consumption by analyzing usage patterns. This strategy:
- Tracks resource usage metrics (memory, CPU, execution time)
- Identifies inefficient parameter configurations
- Recommends parameter adjustments to improve resource utilization

## Integration with Orchestrator

The Workflow Optimizer is integrated into the core `OrchestratorAgent` class, which provides methods to:

1. `optimize_workflow()`: Analyze past executions and apply optimization strategies
2. `compare_optimized_version()`: Compare metrics between original and optimized versions
3. `get_version_execution_metrics()`: Calculate performance metrics for workflow versions
4. `compare_execution_metrics()`: Quantify improvements between versions

## Benefits

- **Improved Performance**: Automatically identifies and resolves bottlenecks
- **Adaptive Agent Selection**: Learns which agents work best for specific tasks
- **Resource Efficiency**: Optimizes resource usage based on observed patterns
- **Continuous Improvement**: Creates new workflow versions that leverage execution insights
- **Quantifiable Metrics**: Provides detailed performance comparisons between versions

## Usage Example

```python
# Optimize a workflow based on execution history
optimization_result = await orchestrator.optimize_workflow(workflow_id="my_workflow")

# Compare the original and optimized versions
comparison = await orchestrator.compare_optimized_version(
    workflow_id="my_workflow",
    original_version_id="v1",
    optimized_version_id=optimization_result["version_id"]
)

# Execute the optimized workflow
result = await orchestrator.execute_workflow(
    workflow_id="my_workflow",
    version_id=optimization_result["version_id"]
)
```

## Extending the Optimizer

You can create custom optimization strategies by inheriting from the `WorkflowOptimizationStrategy` base class:

```python
class CustomOptimizer(WorkflowOptimizationStrategy):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__("custom_strategy")
        self.description = "My custom optimization strategy"
    
    async def optimize(self, workflow, execution_history):
        # Implement your optimization logic here
        return optimized_workflow, optimization_info
        
# Add your custom strategy to the workflow optimizer
orchestrator.workflow_optimizer.add_strategy(CustomOptimizer())
```
