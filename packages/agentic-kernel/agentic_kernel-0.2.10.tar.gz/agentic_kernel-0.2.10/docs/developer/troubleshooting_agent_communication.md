## Common Issues and Solutions

### Agent Not Responding

**Symptoms:**

- Task remains in SUBMITTED or WORKING state indefinitely
- No response from the agent
- Client timeouts

**Possible Causes:**

1. Agent server is not running
2. Network connectivity issues
3. Agent is overloaded or deadlocked
4. Task processing logic has an infinite loop or is blocked

**Solutions:**

1. Verify that the agent server is running and accessible
2. Check network connectivity between client and agent
3. Implement and check timeouts for task processing
4. Add logging to the agent's task processing logic to identify bottlenecks
5. Implement a health check endpoint for the agent

### Task Failures

**Symptoms:**

- Task status changes to FAILED
- Error message in task status
- Exception in agent logs

**Possible Causes:**

1. Invalid input parameters
2. Missing dependencies
3. Internal error in task processing logic
4. External service failure

**Solutions:**

1. Validate input parameters before submitting tasks
2. Add detailed error messages to task failure responses
3. Implement proper error handling in task processing logic
4. Add retry logic for transient failures
5. Check logs for detailed error information

### Communication Timeouts

**Symptoms:**

- Client receives timeout errors
- Tasks appear to be processing but never complete

**Possible Causes:**

1. Network latency
2. Agent processing takes longer than client timeout
3. Agent is overloaded

**Solutions:**

1. Increase client timeout settings
2. Implement streaming updates for long-running tasks
3. Add progress reporting to task processing
4. Scale agent resources to handle load
5. Implement backpressure mechanisms

## Diagnosing Communication Problems

### Check Agent Status

First, verify that the agent is running and accessible:

```python
import aiohttp
import asyncio

async def check_agent_status(agent_url):
    try:
        async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
            async with session.get(f"{agent_url}/health") as response:
                if response.status == 200:
                    print(f"Agent is running at {agent_url}")
                    return True
                else:
                    print(f"Agent returned status {response.status}")
                    return False
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Failed to connect to agent at {agent_url}: {str(e)}")
        return False

asyncio.run(check_agent_status("http://localhost:8000"))
```

### Inspect Task Status

Retrieve and inspect the task status to understand where it's stuck:

```python
from agentic_kernel.communication.a2a.client import A2AClient

async def inspect_task(agent_url, task_id):
    client = A2AClient(agent_url)
    try:
        task = await client.tasks_get(task_id)
        print(f"Task ID: {task.id}")
        print(f"Task Status: {task.status.state}")
        print(f"Task Message: {task.status.message}")
        if task.artifacts:
            print(f"Artifacts: {len(task.artifacts)}")
            for i, artifact in enumerate(task.artifacts):
                print(f"  Artifact {i}: {artifact.name}")
        return task
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Failed to get task {task_id}: {str(e)}")
        return None
    finally:
        await client.close()
```

### Enable Debug Logging

Enable debug logging to get more detailed information:

```python
import logging

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.DEBUG,
    format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'
)

# Set specific loggers to DEBUG level
logging.getLogger('agentic_kernel.communication.a2a').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
```

## A2A Protocol Errors

### JSON-RPC Errors

The A2A protocol uses JSON-RPC 2.0 for communication. Common JSON-RPC errors include:

| Code   | Message          | Description                              | Solution                                                       |
|--------|------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| -32700 | Parse error      | Invalid JSON                             | Check the format of your JSON requests                         |
| -32600 | Invalid request  | Request does not conform to JSON-RPC 2.0 | Ensure your request has jsonrpc, method, id, and params fields |
| -32601 | Method not found | The requested method does not exist      | Check the method name and agent capabilities                   |
| -32602 | Invalid params   | Invalid method parameters                | Check the parameters against the method's requirements         |
| -32603 | Internal error   | Internal JSON-RPC error                  | Check server logs for details                                  |

### A2A-Specific Errors

The A2A protocol defines additional error codes:

| Code   | Description                     | Solution                                                   |
|--------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| -32001 | Task not found                  | Verify the task ID exists and is accessible to the client  |
| -32002 | Task not cancelable             | Only tasks in non-terminal states can be canceled          |
| -32003 | Push notification not supported | The agent does not support push notifications              |
| -32004 | Unsupported operation           | The requested operation is not supported by the agent      |
| -32005 | Content type not supported      | The agent does not support the content type in the request |

## Task Lifecycle Issues

### Task Stuck in SUBMITTED State

**Possible Causes:**

1. Agent is not processing new tasks
2. Task queue is full
3. Task validation is failing

**Solutions:**

1. Check agent logs for errors
2. Verify that the agent's task processing thread/worker is running
3. Check for task validation errors in logs
4. Restart the agent if necessary

### Task Stuck in WORKING State

**Possible Causes:**

1. Agent is processing the task but taking a long time
2. Agent has encountered an issue but hasn't updated the task status
3. Agent process has crashed during task execution

**Solutions:**

1. Implement timeouts for task processing
2. Add progress reporting to long-running tasks
3. Implement watchdog mechanisms to detect and recover from agent crashes
4. Add more detailed logging to task processing logic

### Task Transitions to FAILED Without Clear Error

**Possible Causes:**

1. Exception in task processing logic
2. External service failure
3. Resource constraints (memory, CPU, etc.)

**Solutions:**

1. Improve error handling to capture and report detailed error information
2. Add try/except blocks around external service calls
3. Monitor resource usage during task processing
4. Add more context to error messages

## Streaming and Real-time Updates

### Streaming Updates Not Received

**Symptoms:**

- Client does not receive incremental updates
- Only final result is received

**Possible Causes:**

1. Agent is not configured for streaming
2. Client is not using the streaming API
3. Network or proxy issues with long-lived connections

**Solutions:**

1. Verify that the agent has streaming capability enabled
2. Use the tasks/sendSubscribe method instead of tasks/send
3. Check for proxies or firewalls that might terminate long-lived connections
4. Implement proper error handling for stream disconnections

### Example of Proper Streaming Implementation

```python
from agentic_kernel.communication.a2a.client import A2AClient
from agentic_kernel.communication.a2a.types import Message, TaskSendParams, TextPart

async def stream_task_updates(agent_url, message_text):
    client = A2AClient(agent_url)
    try:
        # Create task parameters
        task_params = TaskSendParams(
            message=Message(
                role="user",
                parts=[
                    TextPart(
                        type="text",
                        text=message_text,
                    )
                ],
            ),
        )
        
        # Subscribe to task updates
        async for event in client.tasks_send_subscribe(task_params):
            if hasattr(event, "status"):
                print(f"Status update: {event.status.state}")
            elif hasattr(event, "artifact"):
                print(f"Artifact update: {event.artifact.name}")
                for part in event.artifact.parts:
                    if hasattr(part, "text"):
                        print(f"  Content: {part.text}")
    finally:
        await client.close()
```

## Authentication and Authorization

### Authentication Failures

**Symptoms:**

- 401 Unauthorized responses
- 403 Forbidden responses

**Possible Causes:**

1. Missing or invalid API key
2. Expired credentials
3. Insufficient permissions

**Solutions:**

1. Verify that the correct API key is being sent
2. Check the authentication configuration on the agent
3. Ensure the client is sending the authentication information correctly
4. Check logs for detailed authentication failure reasons

### Example of Proper Authentication

```python
from agentic_kernel.communication.a2a.client import A2AClient

# Create a client with authentication
client = A2AClient(
    "http://localhost:8000",
    headers={"X-API-Key": "your-api-key"}
)
```

## Performance Issues

### Slow Response Times

**Symptoms:**

- Tasks take a long time to complete
- High latency in agent responses

**Possible Causes:**

1. Agent is overloaded
2. Inefficient task processing logic
3. External service dependencies are slow
4. Resource constraints

**Solutions:**

1. Profile the agent's task processing logic to identify bottlenecks
2. Implement caching for frequently accessed data
3. Optimize database queries and external service calls
4. Scale agent resources (CPU, memory, etc.)
5. Implement load balancing across multiple agent instances

### Memory Leaks

**Symptoms:**

- Agent memory usage grows over time
- Performance degrades over time
- Agent crashes with out-of-memory errors

**Possible Causes:**

1. Tasks or artifacts not being properly cleaned up
2. Circular references preventing garbage collection
3. Large objects being kept in memory unnecessarily

**Solutions:**

1. Implement task and artifact cleanup after completion
2. Set appropriate TTL (time-to-live) for tasks and artifacts
3. Monitor memory usage over time
4. Use memory profiling tools to identify leaks
5. Implement periodic agent restarts if necessary

## Network and Connectivity

### Connection Issues

**Symptoms:**

- Connection refused errors
- Connection reset errors
- Timeouts during connection establishment

**Possible Causes:**

1. Agent server is not running
2. Incorrect host or port configuration
3. Firewall blocking connections
4. Network issues between client and agent

**Solutions:**

1. Verify that the agent server is running
2. Check host and port configuration
3. Test connectivity using basic tools (curl, wget, telnet)
4. Check firewall rules
5. Implement retry logic with exponential backoff

### Example of Robust Connection Handling

```python
import aiohttp
import asyncio
from agentic_kernel.communication.a2a.client import A2AClient

async def send_task_with_retries(agent_url, message_text, max_retries=3):
    retries = 0
    while retries <= max_retries:
        try:
            client = A2AClient(agent_url)
            # Create and send task
            # ...
            return result
        except aiohttp.ClientConnectorError as e:
            retries += 1
            if retries > max_retries:
                raise
            wait_time = 2 ** retries  # Exponential backoff
            print(f"Connection error: {str(e)}. Retrying in {wait_time} seconds...")
            await asyncio.sleep(wait_time)
        finally:
            if 'client' in locals():
                await client.close()
```

## Debugging Tools and Techniques

### Logging

Implement comprehensive logging throughout the agent communication flow:

```python
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

async def process_task(self, params):
    logger.info(f"Processing task: {params.id or 'new task'}")
    try:
        # Process task
        logger.debug(f"Task parameters: {params}")
        # ...
        logger.info(f"Task {task.id} processed successfully")
        return task
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error processing task: {str(e)}", exc_info=True)
        raise
```

### Request/Response Tracing

Implement request/response tracing to debug communication issues:

```python
class TracingMiddleware:
    async def __call__(self, request, handler):
        request_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
        logger.debug(f"[{request_id}] Request: {request.method} {request.url}")
        
        try:
            response = await handler(request)
            logger.debug(f"[{request_id}] Response: {response.status}")
            return response
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"[{request_id}] Error: {str(e)}")
            raise
```

### Using Network Inspection Tools

Tools like Wireshark, tcpdump, or browser developer tools can help inspect the raw communication between agents:

1. **Wireshark**: Capture and analyze HTTP/HTTPS traffic
2. **curl**: Test API endpoints directly
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/jsonrpc \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"1","method":"agent/getCard","params":{}}'
   ```
3. **Browser Developer Tools**: Inspect network requests and responses when using web interfaces

## Advanced Troubleshooting

### Implementing Health Checks

Add a health check endpoint to your agent server:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/health")
async def health_check():
    # Check critical components
    db_healthy = await check_database_connection()
    cache_healthy = await check_cache_connection()
    
    if db_healthy and cache_healthy:
        return {"status": "healthy"}
    else:
        return {"status": "unhealthy", "details": {
            "database": db_healthy,
            "cache": cache_healthy
        }}
```

### Implementing Circuit Breakers

Use circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures when external services are unavailable:

```python
from circuitbreaker import circuit

@circuit(failure_threshold=5, recovery_timeout=30)
async def call_external_service(params):
    # Call external service
    # If this fails too many times, the circuit will open
    # and subsequent calls will fail immediately
    return await external_service_client.call(params)
```

### Distributed Tracing

For complex multi-agent systems, implement distributed tracing:

```python
from opentelemetry import trace
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import BatchSpanProcessor
from opentelemetry.exporter.jaeger.thrift import JaegerExporter

# Set up the tracer
trace.set_tracer_provider(TracerProvider())
tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)

# Set up the Jaeger exporter
jaeger_exporter = JaegerExporter(
    agent_host_name="localhost",
    agent_port=6831,
)
trace.get_tracer_provider().add_span_processor(
    BatchSpanProcessor(jaeger_exporter)
)

# Use the tracer in your code
async def process_task(self, params):
    with tracer.start_as_current_span("process_task"):
        # Process the task
        # ...
```

By following this troubleshooting guide, you should be able to diagnose and resolve most common issues that arise in
agent communication using the A2A protocol. Remember that good logging, monitoring, and error handling are key to
building robust multi-agent systems.
