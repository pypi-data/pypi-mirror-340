# BeeMCP - A Bee MCP Server

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/beemcp.svg?cache=1)](https://badge.fury.io/py/beemcp)
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

**Unofficial** Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for interacting with your [Bee wearable](https://bee.computer/) lifelogging data.  More context [on my blog](https://rogerpincombe.com/beemcp).

This server acts as a bridge, allowing Large Language Models (LLMs) like Claude or custom AI agents to access and interact with your personal data stored in Bee, including conversations, facts, to-dos, and location history.

**Disclaimer:** This is an unofficial project and is not affiliated with Bee. Use it at your own risk. Ensure you understand the security implications of granting AI access to your personal data via the API key.

## Core Concept

Bee.computer helps you capture moments from your life (conversations, places visited, notes). `beemcp` makes this data available to your AI assistant through the Model Context Protocol. This means you can ask your AI questions like:

*   "What important things did I discuss last week?"
*   "Remind me about Brad's dietary preferences."
*   "Where was I last Tuesday afternoon?"
*   "Add 'Book flight tickets' to my reminders."

The AI, using `beemcp`, can securely fetch or modify this information from your Bee.computer account.

## Prerequisites

1.  **Python:** Version 3.10 or higher.
2.  **Bee.computer API Key:** You need an [API key from your Bee account settings](https://developer.bee.computer/keys).

## Installation

You can install and run `beemcp` using `uv` (recommended) or `pip`.

### Using uv (recommended)

[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) is a fast Python package installer and resolver. If you have `uv` installed, you don't need to install `beemcp` separately. You can run it directly using [`uvx`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/):

```bash
# Example of running directly (requires API key configured, see below)
uvx beemcp
```

### Using PIP

Alternatively, you can install `beemcp` using `pip`:

```bash
pip install beemcp
```

After installation, you can run it as a Python module:

```bash
python -m beemcp.beemcp
```

Or, if the entry point is correctly added to your system's PATH during installation, you might be able to run it directly:

```bash
beemcp
```

## Configuration

### 1. API Key Setup (required)

`beemcp` requires your Bee API key to function. **Never share this key publicly or commit it to version control.**

Get your API key from the [Bee developer website here](https://developer.bee.computer/keys).

If running in Claude or another MCP client, you will likely provide the `BEE_API_TOKEN` environment variable in the client's configuration.

If running directly from the command line, provide the key is using a `.env` file in the directory where you run the `beemcp` server:

1.  Create a file named `.env` in the same directory you intend to run `beemcp` from.
2.  Add the following line to the `.env` file, replacing `your_actual_bee_api_key_here` with your real key:

    ```dotenv
    BEE_API_TOKEN="your_actual_bee_api_key_here"
    ```

Alternatively, you can set the `BEE_API_TOKEN` environment variable directly in your system or shell:

```bash
export BEE_API_TOKEN="your_actual_bee_api_key_here"
# Now run the server in the same shell session
uvx beemcp
```

**The server will exit with an error if the `BEE_API_TOKEN` is not found.**

### 2. Connecting to LLM Clients

You need to tell your LLM client (like Claude.app or Zed) how to start and communicate with the `beemcp` server.

#### Configure for Claude.app

Add the following to your Claude settings (`settings.json`):

>Using uvx (Recommended):

```json
"mcpServers": {
  "beemcp": {
    "command": "uvx",
    "args": ["beemcp"],
    "env": {"BEE_API_TOKEN": "<YOUR API KEY HERE>"}
  }
}
```

<details>
<summary>Using pip installation</summary>

```json
"mcpServers": {
  "bee": {
    "command": "python",
    "args": ["-m", "beemcp.beemcp"],
    "env": {"BEE_API_TOKEN": "<YOUR API KEY HERE>"}
  }
}
```
</details>

If you go to the `Settings` window in Claude Desktop and open the `Developer` tab, you should see something like this:

![Example Claude Desktop Configuration](https://github.com/OkGoDoIt/beemcp/raw/master/claude-desktop-configuration.png)

#### Configure for Zed

Add the following to your Zed `settings.json`:

<details>
<summary>Using uvx (Recommended)</summary>

```json
"context_servers": [
  {
    "name": "beemcp",
    "command": "uvx",
    "args": ["beemcp"],
    "env": {"BEE_API_TOKEN": "<YOUR API KEY HERE>"}
  }
],
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Using pip installation</summary>

```json
"context_servers": [
  {

    "env": {"BEE_API_TOKEN": "<YOUR API KEY HERE>"}
  }
],
```

## Available Resources

MCP Resources provide direct access to data, often used for context or caching by the LLM client. many LLm clients do not support resources very well, so the "Tools" listed above are provided even when they may be redundant.

*   `bee://conversations`: List summaries of all conversations.
*   `bee://conversations/{id}`: Get full details for a specific conversation.
*   `bee://facts`: List summaries of all confirmed facts.
*   `bee://facts/{id}`: Get full details for a specific fact.
*   `bee://todos`: List summaries of all todos.
*   `bee://todos/incomplete`: List summaries of incomplete todos.
*   `bee://todos/{id}`: Get full details for a specific todo.
*   `bee://locations`: List summaries of all recorded locations (combined sequentially).

## Debugging

You can use the MCP inspector tool (`@modelcontextprotocol/inspector`) to interact with and debug the `beemcp` server directly.

If you installed using `uv` and are running with `uvx`:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uvx beemcp
```

If you installed using `pip`:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector python -m beemcp.beemcp
```

If you are developing locally within the project directory:

```bash
# Assuming you are in the root directory of the beemcp project
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector python -m beemcp.beemcp
# Or if using uv for development
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uv run beemcp.beemcp
```

## Example Questions for your LLM

Try asking your AI assistant questions like these to leverage `beemcp`:

*   "What conversations did I have yesterday?"
*   "Look up the conversation with John about the project."
*   "Remember that I like my coffee black." (-> `record-user-fact`)
*   "Actually, I take milk in my coffee." (-> `update-user-fact`)
*   "What's on my todo list?"
*   "Show me my incomplete tasks."
*   "Add 'Buy groceries' to my reminders."
*   "Mark the 'Send report' todo as done."
*   "Where did I go last weekend?"
*   "What places did I visit today?"
