# ðŸš§ BrowserState for Python - COMING SOON ðŸš§

The Python implementation of BrowserState is under active development and will be available soon. 

# Why BrowserState?
Most browser automation workflows fail because authentication and session data don't persist reliably across environments. Manually handling cookies or re-authenticating slows everything down. Worse, many automations fail due to inconsistent browser fingerprints, machine IDs, and storage statesâ€”leading to bot detection and bans.

BrowserState ensures your automation behaves like a real, returning user by providing:

Full Browser Context Restoration â€“ Save and restore cookies, local storage, IndexedDB, service worker caches, and extension data. Resume automation 
from the exact previous state.

Multi-Instance Synchronization â€“ Share browser profiles across multiple servers or devices, making automation scalable and resilient.

Zero-Setup Onboarding for Automation â€“ Instantly deploy automation-ready browser profiles without manual setup.

Efficient Resource Usage â€“ Persistent browser usage without memory leaks, eliminating the need to launch new instances for every run.

Faster Debugging & Reproducibility â€“ Store failing test cases exactly as they were, making it easy to diagnose automation failures.

Offline Execution & Caching â€“ Automate tasks that rely on cached assets, such as scraping content behind paywalls or working in low-connectivity environments.

Cross-Device Synchronization â€“ Seamlessly move between local development, cloud servers, and headless automation.

âœ… Bot Detection Bypass
Many bot detection systems track inconsistencies in browser statesâ€”frequent changes to fingerprints, device identifiers, and storage behavior trigger red flags. Most people get detected because they unknowingly create a "new machine" every time.

BrowserState solves this by preserving a stable, persistent browser identity across runs instead of resetting key markers. This drastically reduces detection risks while maintaining full automation control.

Now you can move fast without breaking sessionsâ€”or getting flagged as a bot.

## Features (Coming Soon)

- Save browser profiles (cookies, local storage, etc.) to different storage providers
- Restore browser profiles on different machines
- Support for multiple storage providers:
  - Local storage
  - AWS S3
  - Google Cloud Storage
  - Redis
- Works with popular browser automation tools:
  - Selenium
  - Playwright
  - Puppeteer (via Pyppeteer)

## Implementation Roadmap

| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Local Storage | ðŸš§ In Development |
| S3 Storage | ðŸš§ In Development |
| Redis Storage | ðŸš§ In Development |
| GCS Storage | ðŸš§ In Development |

## Installation (Pre-Release)

While BrowserState for Python is not yet available on PyPI, you can install it in several ways:

### Using pip with GitHub repository
```bash
# Install directly from GitHub repository
pip install git+https://github.com/browserstate-org/browserstate#subdirectory=python
```

### Using GitHub Packages (recommended)
Once we publish to GitHub Packages, you'll be able to install it using:

```bash
# Install directly from GitHub Packages (for public packages)
pip install browserstate --index-url https://pip.pkg.github.com/browserstate-org

# Using uv
uv pip install browserstate --index-url https://pip.pkg.github.com/browserstate-org
```

For permanent configuration, add this to your pip configuration:
```bash
pip config set global.extra-index-url https://pip.pkg.github.com/browserstate-org
```

### Using uv (faster alternative)
```bash
# First install uv if you don't have it
pip install uv
# Or with pipx for isolated installation
pipx install uv

# Then install browserstate from GitHub
uv pip install git+https://github.com/browserstate-org/browserstate#subdirectory=python
```

### From source
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/browserstate-org/browserstate
cd browserstate/python

# Install with pip
pip install .

# Or with uv
uv pip install .
```

Once the package is officially released on PyPI, you'll be able to install it with:
```bash
pip install browserstate
# or
uv pip install browserstate
```
