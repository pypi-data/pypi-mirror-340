                                2. Developer provided expectations for the LLM agent's responses.

                                You will compare the actual conversation against the provided expectations.

                                Example output:
                                {{ "score": 9, "reasoning": "The agent succeeded in helping the user as expected"}}

                                Only return the JSON object.
