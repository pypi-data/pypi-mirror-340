# python-wiiu-ristretto
Python wrapper for communicating with Wii U consoles using the [Ristretto](https://github.com/ItzSwirlz/Ristretto) API

Note: Currently, Ristretto only supports HTTP and not HTTPS. Also, when in vWii Mode, or when applets are active, Ristretto is not active. Furthermore, there is currently no way to power on the console from its power off state.

Warning: I am not responsible for what you do with your console.
