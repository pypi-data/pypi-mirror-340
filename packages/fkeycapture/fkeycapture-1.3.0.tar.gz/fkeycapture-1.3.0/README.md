# fkeycapture
This is a simple and easy to use package that allows you to capture individual keystrokes from the user.
#### Forms:
1. (Default) Recive key as a string
2. Recive key as bytes (get only)
3. Recive key as ints  (getnum only)
#### How to Use:
1. from fkeycapture import get, getnum, getchars
2. Use get like this: `get(keycount = any int, returnBytes = True or False)`
3. Use getnum like this: `getnum(keycount = any int, ints = True or False)`
4. Use getchars like this: `getchars(keycount = any int, chars = list of chars, returnBytes = True or False)`
