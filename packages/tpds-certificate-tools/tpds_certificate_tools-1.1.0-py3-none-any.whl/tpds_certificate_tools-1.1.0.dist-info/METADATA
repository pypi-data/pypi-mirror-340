## TPDS Certificate Tools Package

TPDS Certificate Tools contains certificate support and certificate handling scripts


# Instructions to generate the Signer certificates from CSRs

This package contains the required scripts and files to perform sign operation of the CSRs provided by Microchip.


1. Installing this package and it's included scripts

```
    python -m pip install tpds-certificate-tools
```

2. Extract the CSRs zip file provided by Microchip Provisioning Services. Use this path as --in-path

3. Create a folder to store the generated signer certificates. Use this path as --out-path

4. Provide the signer CA key to sign the CSRs as --cakey.

5. Use the signer.crt available in this package as --cacert.

    Following is the example command for reference
    ```
        python sign_csr.py --in-path test_csrs --out-path test_csrs_out --cakey signer_ca.key --cacert signer.crt
    ```

6. This should generate signers signed by signer_ca in --out-path folder. Zip this folder and share to Microchip Provisioning Services along with Provisioning package generated on TPDS Configurator.
