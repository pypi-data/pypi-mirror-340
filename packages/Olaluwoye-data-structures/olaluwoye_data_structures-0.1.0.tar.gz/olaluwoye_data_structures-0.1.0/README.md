# data-structures-python

A beginner-friendly Python package that implements classic data structures from scratch using **object-oriented Python**. Designed to help learners understand how data structures work under the hood without relying on Pythonâ€™s built-in abstractions.

Whether you're a coding bootcamp student, computer science learner, or self-taught developer â€” this package is for you.

## Why This Project?

Most learners rely on built-in Python data types (lists, sets, dicts) without truly understanding how they work under the hood.

This package is designed for:
- Beginners who want hands-on experience
- Bootcamp students preparing for interviews
- Anyone transitioning into software engineering or data structures


## ðŸ§  Whatâ€™s Inside?

This package provides detailed implementations and clean interfaces for the following data structures:

| Data Structure       | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| âœ… **Array**          | Dynamic array with index-based operations |
| âœ… **Stack**          | LIFO stack implemented using both a Python list and a linked list |
| âœ… **Queue**          | FIFO queue implemented using a list |
| âœ… **Linked List**    | Singly linked list with insert, delete, search, and update operations |
| âœ… **Doubly Linked List** | Bi-directional traversal with flexible insert/delete |
| âœ… **Binary Search Tree (BST)** | Recursive insert, search, and in-order traversal |
| âœ… **Graph**          | Undirected graph using an adjacency list |

All implementations are **self-contained**, easy to understand, and extensible for future improvements (e.g., weighted graphs, AVL trees, etc.).
