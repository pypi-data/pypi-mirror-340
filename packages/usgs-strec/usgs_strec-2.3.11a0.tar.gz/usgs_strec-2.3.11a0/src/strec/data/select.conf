# The tectonic_regions section should include sub-sections for all of the
# regions that can be reported by STREC. Each subsection (except for
# 'subduction' should have the following elements:
#   horizontal_buffer - a buffer that extends into neighboring regions
#       across which the GMPEs are blended.
#   min_depth - A list of one or more minimum depths corresponding to
#       the GMPEs listed under 'gmpe'.
#   max_depth - A list of one or more maximum depths corresponding to
#       the GMPEs listed under 'gmpe'.
#   vertical_buffer - if the GMPE selection is depth dependent, (i.e.,
#       ther is more than one GMPE set configured under 'gmpe') this
#       buffer determines the width of the zone over which one GMPE set
#       is blended into the next.
#
# Min/max depth ranges should span all possible event depths.

# For p_int_hypo, the x axis represents the absolute value of the

# For p_int_kagan, the x axis represents the Kagan angle between the moment tensor
# and the slab.
#
# For p_int_sz, the x axis represents the difference between hypocentral depth
# and the bottom of the seismogenic zone, given to us by the USGS Slab 2.0 model.
#
# For p_crust_slab, the x axis represents the (non-absolute value of) the
# difference between the hypocentral depth and the depth to the slab.
#
# For p_crust_hypo, the x axis represents the hypocentral depth and whether it
# is close to the average crustal thickness (33 km).
#
# p_kagan_default is the default value we use for Kagan angle probability in the
# absence of any moment tensor.

# For p_int_mag, the x axis represents magnitudes between which an event has
# an increasing chance of being interface. This is only used when earthquake is
# in a subduction region but not above a mapped portion of the slab.

# earthquake is in a subduction region but not above a mapped portion of the slab.
# Define a depth range for interface events at mid-range of depth, constructed
# by summing two ramp functions. An earthquake is more likely to be interface
# if depth is greater than upper x2 and less than lower x1.  The probability becomes
# 0 at upper x1 and lower x2.
