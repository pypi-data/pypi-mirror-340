## Overview

The Edgegap CLI includes various tools and helpers for helping with Scheduling Task.
It is designed for use within the Edgegap organization.

## Installation

To install this library, ensure you have Python and `poetry` installed. Then, use the following command:

```bash
poetry add edgegap-scheduling
```

Ensure you have the necessary permissions to install and use this library, as it is intended for Edgegap employees only.

## Usage

Please consult Obsidian Documentation for Usage

## Seeder

The `db` feature have the option to seed data in any postgresql database

you can invoke it with the CLI like this

```shell
# Not safe since it will write the pass in the history
edgegap-cli db seed --uri 'postgresql://<user>:<pass>@<localhost>:<port>/<db>' --folder /path/to/json/folder

# or, using stdin and setting the URI into a variable or env variable
echo "$POSTGRES_URI" | edgegap-cli db seed --uri 'stdin' --folder /path/to/json/folder
```

This will scan 2 folders of depth into the `/path/to/json/folder` and will try to load all json file into the 

`SeederModel` (pydantic load), any bad file or data will be discarded but the script will run all valid one

You can inspect the `SeederModel.schema()` to see the documentation for the fields

All `SeederElement` are wrapped in a database transaction and any failure of a sub-elements will result in a rollback
of the parent/child in creation. The script won't exit completely in such case but rather skip the Element and seed
the rest of the Seeds/Elements

## Running Tests

To run tests for this library, you need to have pytest installed. You can install dev dependencies with:

```bash
poetry install --with=dev
```

then run

```bash
pytest
```

This will execute all the tests in the tests folder.

```bash
poetry config pypi-token.pypi <your-api-token>
poetry version x.x.x
poetry publish --build
```
