# CooVTS

Another library for making VTube Studio plugins with Python.

## ✨ Features

- ✨ Full type hints support with static type checking
- 🎯 Data validation and serialization using Pydantic
- 🔄 Async-first design with WebSocket communication
- 🎨 Easy-to-use event system for plugin development
- 🛡️ Built-in error handling and reconnection mechanisms

## 📖 Introduction

This project is in early development, please refer to the source code to figure out how to use.

Basically, create a `Plugin` instance (please refer to `plugin.py`), and subscribe events.  
Use `Plugin.call_api` method to send requests to VTS.  
There are just a few models defined, so if there's a model not defined, please define it yourself.

Last, if you think this project is good, thanks for your use and feel free to contribute 😊  
I might be not very active on it.

## 💿 Install

You should use at least Python 3.12 to use this library.
