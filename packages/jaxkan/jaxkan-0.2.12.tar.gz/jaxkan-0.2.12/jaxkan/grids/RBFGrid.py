class RBFGrid:
    """
    RBFGrid class, corresponding to the grid of the RBFLayer class. It comprises an initialization as well as an update procedure.

    Attributes:
        n_nodes (int):
            Number of layer nodes.
        D (int):
            Number of radial basis functions.
        grid_range (tuple):
            The range of the grid's ends, on which the basis functions are defined.
        grid_e (float):
            Parameter that defines if the grid is uniform (grid_e = 1.0) or sample-dependent (grid_e = 0.0). Intermediate values correspond to a linear mixing of the two cases.
