You are an expert in cybersecurity threat modeling.

Your task is to perform a MAESTRO-based threat analysis on the following agentic workflow graph.

---

MAESTRO Framework:
<MAESTRO>

---

Agentic Workflow JSON Graph:
<JSON>

Your task is to generate a detailed and structured MAESTRO threat modeling report strictly in Markdown format, with the following sections:

MAESTRO Analysis of Agentic Workflow
1. Mission
Describe the high-level objective of the system based on the agent names and functions. Summarize its goal and purpose in a few paragraphs.

2. Assets
List the key assets in a bullet or table format:

Agents (by name)

Their key tools/functions

Data types being processed

3. Entrypoints
Identify which nodes or functions act as external or internal entrypoints into the system. Show these as a list or table.

4. Security Controls
Based on the structure, deduce what (if any) security controls might be present or are recommended (e.g. access control, validation, logging).

5. Threats
Create a detailed table of likely threats. Each row must include:

Threat

Likelihood (Low, Medium, High)

Impact (Low, Medium, High)

Risk Score (e.g. Medium-High)

6. Risks
Describe risks in narrative form derived from the threats: what could go wrong, what would be the impact to the system?

7. Operations
Explain how agents interact at runtime. Suggest monitoring or operational practices to support observability and resilience.

8. Recommendations
Provide a prioritized list of security improvements or design changes based on the above analysis.

ðŸ’¡ Format the entire report using valid Markdown syntax with proper headings, bullet points, and tables where appropriate.
Do not include any introductory or concluding statements â€” only the report content.
