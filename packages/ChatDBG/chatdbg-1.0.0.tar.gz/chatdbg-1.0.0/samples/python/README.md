# Python Tests

* Install the packages in `requirements.txt`.  Some of the tests use them.

* Run, for example:

    ```
    chatdbg -c continue marbles.py
    ```

* *NOTE*: one python package used by the programs has been replaced
   with a small python stub to hide the author's identity.  That may
   change how ChatDBG works, since it includes that stub as part of
   the user-defined code.
