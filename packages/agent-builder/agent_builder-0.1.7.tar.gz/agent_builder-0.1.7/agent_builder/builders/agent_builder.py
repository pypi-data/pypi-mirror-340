class AgentBuilder(BaseBuilder):
    """
    A builder class for constructing agents that interact with tools, memory, goals,
    and Language Learning Models (LLMs). This class follows a builder pattern,
    providing methods to configure various components of the agent and ensure
    the agent is fully customizable.

    The agent can be configured with:
    - LLMs (Language Learning Models)
    - Tools (for extended capabilities)
    - A goal or objective (to guide the agent's purpose)
    - Memory (for persistent knowledge or interaction history)
    - Action control mechanisms (to manage agent behavior)
    - Delegation agents (for task delegation)

    Attributes
    ----------
    agent : Agent
        The final agent object that is built by this builder.
    llm : Any
        The language model (e.g., GPT) that the agent will use for responses.
    tools : list
        A list of tools that the agent can use to perform specific tasks.
    goal : str
        The primary goal or objective of the agent.
    role : str
        The role assigned to the agent (e.g., assistant, expert).
    action_control : OpenAIToolsAgentOutputParser
        The action control mechanism to manage how the agent interprets
        and executes actions.
    format_intermediate_steps : Callable
        A function to format intermediate steps during the agent's execution process.
    memory_object : object
        The memory configuration used to enable memory-based capabilities for the agent.
    delegating_agents : list
        A list of other agents to which tasks can be delegated by the primary agent.
