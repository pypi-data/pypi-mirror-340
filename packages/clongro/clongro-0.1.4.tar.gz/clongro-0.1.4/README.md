# clongro

Simple code to estimate the exponential growth rate of each clone in a barcoded cell population from targeted barcode sequencing data from at least two timepoints.

### Getting started
Install `clongro` using pip:
```
pip install clongro
```

Run an example data set
```
clongro --data data/test_data_1/data.tsv --meta data/test_data_1/meta.csv --pop-growth-rate 0.02 --outs clongro_test_data_1_outs
```

###### Derivation 
First, we show how to determine the exponential growth rate of a bulk population from:

```math
{N_{pop}}_f = {N_{pop}}_0e^{Rt}
```

Solving for growth rate ${R}$ as:

```math
R = {\dfrac{1}{t}}ln \Biggl({\dfrac{{N_{pop}}_f}{{N_{pop}}_0}}\Biggr)
```

Now, if we want to determine the growth rate of each clone in the population, we can use the same equation as above but for each clone $i$ from:

```math
{N_f}_i = {N_0}_ie^{r_{i}t}
```

Solving for clonal growth rate ${r}_i$ as:

```math
r_i = {\dfrac{1}{t}}ln\Biggl({\dfrac{{N_f}_i}{{N_0}_i}}\Biggr)
```

From targeted barcode sequencing data, we can find clonal abundance as the percent of each clone in the population (${percent}_{i}$). If we know the size of the bulk population (${N_{pop}}$) and the percent of each clone within the total population, then for each clone $i$, it's total cell number in the population can be computed as:

```math
N_i = {N_{pop}}\biggl(\dfrac{p_i}{100}\biggr)
```

This can be used as ${N_f}_i$ and ${N_0}$ in the clonal growth rate equation:

```math
r_i = {\dfrac{1}{t}}ln\Biggl({\dfrac{{{N_{pop}}_f}({p_i}_f /\ {100})}{{{{N_{pop}}_0}({p_i}_0 /\ {100})}}}\Biggr)
```

Which given log rules can be re-written as:

```math
r_i = {\dfrac{1}{t}}ln\Biggl({\dfrac{{{N_{pop}}_f}}{{N_{pop}}_0}}\Biggr) + {\dfrac{1}{t}}ln\Biggl(\dfrac{{p_i}_f}{{p_i}_0}\Biggr)
```

In this form, we note that the first term on the right side of the equation is simply the growth rate of the total population $R$ and the second term becomes a scaling factor for each clone.

```math
r_i = R + {\dfrac{1}{t}}ln\biggl(\dfrac{{p_i}_f}{{p_i}_0}\biggr)
```

`clongro` uses the percent of each clone from targeted barcode sequencing and the time between each targeted sequencing run to calculate this growth rate scaling factor for each clone. 

If the growth rate of the bulk population $R$, is known, then true growth rate estimates can be determined for each clone by simply adding this scaling factor to the bulk growth rate. `clongro` returns these values as `est_r_i_scaled` in the output csv.

If the growth rate of the bulk population R is not known, then `clongro` uses $R=0$ and returns the computed scaling factor as the unscaled estimate for growth rate of each clone. Even without a known bulk population growth rate ($R$), the unscaled estimates for $r_i$ encode for relative relationships between clones and can be used to identify clones that are growing faster (`est_r_i > 0`) or slower (`est_r_i < 0`) than the bulk population.




### Required inputs
`clongro` requires two input tsv/csv files and can be run simply as:

```
clongro --data {PATH_TO_YOUR_BARCODE_DATA} --meta {PATH_TO_YOUR_METADATA}
```

1. `--data` A csv or tsv in long format with named columns for 'barcode', 'sample', and 'percent'. If you have run pycashier on your targeted sequencing data, outputs from [`pycashier`](https://github.com/brocklab/pycashier) [`receipt`](https://docs.brocklab.com/pycashier/usage.html#receipt) can be used directly here. This can be formatted manually, but ensure that each barcode gets a unique row for each sample/timepoint.

2. `--meta` A csv or tsv with named columns for 'sample', 'time', and 'sample_group'. This maps each sample to a specific experimental timepoint. The time column should be in hours. If you are only running one experiment, then sample_group can be left blank or you can give both samples the same sample_group name, e.g. 'A' in the example below


| sample                  | time | sample_group |
|-------------------------|------|--------------|
| my_barcoded_cells_early | 0    | A            |
| my_barcoded_cells_late  | 840  | A            |


Each 'sample_group' must map to EXACTLY two samples, one denoting the initial timepoint and the other denoting the later timepoint. 'sample_group' can be used to estimate growth rates of clones from separate experiments in a single run of clongro, e.g. 

| sample     | time | sample_group |
|------------|------|--------------|
| HEK_early  | 0    | A            |
| HEK_late   | 840  | A            |
| MCF7_early | 0    | B            |
| MCF7_late  | 1000 | B            |


When `clongro` is run with just `--data` and `--meta`, it will return a csv (default: `outs/clongro_outs.csv`) which contains unscaled, relative estimates of clonal growth rates for each clonal population that was detected and quantified in both timepoints. Barcodes which were not identified in both timepoints will return null for growth rates.



### Optional inputs to estimate true growth rate

##### Single population growth rate for all sample groups
If you are only running one 'sample_group' or all 'sample_group's are estimated to have the same bulk population growth rate ($R$), then the bulk population growth rate in $h^{-1}$ can be supplied at the command line. To call this option at the command line, use the `--pop-growth-rate` flag, i.e.:

```
clongro --data {PATH_TO_YOUR_BARCODE_DATA} --meta {PATH_TO_YOUR_METADATA} --pop-growth-rate 0.02
```
`clongro` will return a csv (default: `outs/clongro_outs.csv`) with scaled estimates of clonal growth rates for each barcode that was detected and quantified in both timepoints. Barcodes which were not identified in both timepoints will return null for growth rates.


##### Different growth rates for each 'sample_group'
If you are running clongro with 'sample_group's that are expected to have the different bulk population growth rates ($R$), then a csv should be provided mapping each 'sample_group' to its known bulk population growth rate.

Data must have named columns for 'sample_group' and 'bulk_growth_rate_R' in inverse hours $h^{-1}$. Groups in 'sample_group' must match those in the sample metadata. The mean population growth rate (`bulk_growth_rate_R`) can be estimated from cell counting, live-cell imaging, or other methods. Providing this file is optional, but it will allow for true estimates of clonal growth rates within each 'sample_group'. An example is below:

| sample_group | bulk_growth_rate_R |
|--------------|--------------------|
| A            | 0.02               |
| B            | 0.025              |

To call this option at the command line, use the `--growths` flag and point to a tsv/csv containing your growth rate data with the columns properly names, i.e.:

```
clongro --data {PATH_TO_YOUR_BARCODE_DATA} --meta {PATH_TO_YOUR_METADATA} --growths {PATH_TO_GROWTH_RATE_METADATA}
```
`clongro` will return a csv (default: `outs/clongro_outs.csv`) with scaled estimates of clonal growth rates for each barcode in each 'sample_group' that was detected and quantified in both timepoints for that 'sample_group'. Barcodes which were not identified in both timepoints will return null for growth rates.



### More complex meta data 'sample_group' examples

In the meta data file, 'sample_group' can also be used to map a single sample to multiple groups using semicolon separation, such as the case where multiple replicates are split off from a shared initial timepoint, e.g.

| sample                      | time | sample_group |
|-----------------------------|------|--------------|
| my_barcoded_cells_early     | 0    | A;B;C;D;E    |
| my_barcoded_cells_late_rep1 | 840  | A            |
| my_barcoded_cells_late_rep2 | 840  | B            |
| my_barcoded_cells_late_rep3 | 840  | C            |
| my_barcoded_cells_late_rep4 | 840  | D            |
| my_barcoded_cells_late_rep5 | 840  | E            |

Or if sequential passaging was performed, the 'sample_group' column can contain multiple groups separated by semicolons to indicate use as the initial timepoint for one 'sample_group' and the final timepoint for another from as in one of the example data sets provided:

`data/test_data_1/meta.csv`
| sample           | sample_group | passage | time |
|------------------|--------------|---------|------|
| JA21116-libB3    | A            | 15      | 0    |
| JA22214-1KB3-P17 | A;B          | 17      | 144  |
| JA22214-1KB3-P19 | B;C          | 19      | 288  |
| JA22214-1KB3-P21 | C;D          | 21      | 432  |
| JA22214-1KB3-P23 | D;E          | 23      | 576  |
| JA22214-1KB3-P25 | E;F          | 25      | 720  |
| JA22214-1KB3-P27 | F;G          | 27      | 864  |
| JA22214-1KB3-P29 | G;H          | 29      | 1008 |
| JA22214-1KB3-P31 | H            | 31      | 1152 |


### Running example data
Two data sets are provided which can be run as examples, to learn more about the unique setups in each experiment, reference the ABOUT.md files in each test_data subdirectory.

To run test data set #1
```
clongro --data data/test_data_1/data.tsv --meta data/test_data_1/meta.csv --pop-growth-rate 0.02 --outs clongro_test_data_1_outs
```

To run test data set #2
```
clongro --data data/test_data_2/data.tsv --meta data/test_data_2/meta.csv --growths data/test_data_2/bulk_growth_rates.csv --outs clongro_test_data_2_outs
```


### Understanding outputs
The returned outputs will retain columns supplied in the meta data files and will minimally have columns for 'barcode', 'sample_group', 'interval', 'duration', 'est_r_i', 'bulk_growth', and 'est_r_i_scaled'.

Barcodes which were not detected in both timepoints are removed by default, to return all data including null values in the output, use the flag `--drop-empty False`

Column info:
- **barcode**: name of the clone
- **sample_group**: the group containing the set of before and after data used to estimate this growth rate
- **interval**: exact time interval used for this calculation, i.e. time0_timef $[h]$
- **duration**: time between initial and final timepoints (equivalent to $t$ in the exponential growth equations) $[h]$
- **est_r_i**: unscaled relative growth rate (i.e. the mathematically derived 'growth rate scaling factor') $[h^{-1}]$
- **bulk_growth**: the bulk population growth rate ($R$) supplied by the user. Default is 0. $[h^{-1}]$
- **est_r_i_scaled** : scaled growth rate (i.e. $r_i$ ) $[h^{-1}]$

The most important output is `est_r_i_scaled` this is the estimated growth rate of for each barcode within each sample group. If bulk growth rate ($R$) was provided, then `est_r_i_scaled` is closer to true estimate of growth rate. If bulk growth rate was not provided, this is a relative estimate of clonal growth rate compared the population average.
