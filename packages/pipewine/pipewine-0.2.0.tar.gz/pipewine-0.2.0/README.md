Pipewine is a complete rewrite of the [Pipelime](https://github.com/eyecan-ai/pipelime-python.git) library and intends to serve the same purpose: provide a set of tools to manipulate multi-modal small/medium-sized datasets, mainly for research purposes in the CV/ML domain.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Unified access pattern** to datasets of various formats, origin and content.
- **Underfolder**, a quick and easy filesystem-based dataset format good for small/medium datasets.
- **Common data encoding** formats for images, text and metadata.
- **Common operators** to manipulate existing datasets.
- **Workflows** that transform data in complex DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graph) pipelines.
- **CLI** (Command Line Interface) to quickly run simple workflows without writing a full python script.
- **Extendibility**, allowing the user to easily extend the library in many aspects, adding components that seamlessly integrate with the built-in ones:
    - Add custom dataset formats
    - Add custom data encoding formats
    - Add custom operators on datasets
    - Register components to the CLI
