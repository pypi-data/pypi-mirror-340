# AsroNLP - NLP for Indonesian Text Processing

AsroNLP is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) package for processing Indonesian text. It includes functionalities such as stopword removal, stemming, sentiment analysis, and visualizations.

## Features

- **Preprocessing**: Tokenization, case folding, stopword removal, and normalization.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes sentiment based on a predefined lexicon of positive and negative words.
- **Visualizations**: WordCloud and Top 10 Frequent Words for each sentiment (Positive, Negative, Neutral).
- **Support for custom resources**: Easily load stopwords, lexicons, and other resources from local files.

## Requirements

To install all the necessary libraries and dependencies, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Install Python

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Step 2: Set Up Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)

It's a good practice to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies for your project.

1. Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```
2. Activate the virtual environment:

   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

You can install the required libraries by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

Or By Manual
nltk
pandas
openpyxl
matplotlib
swifter
rich
wordcloud
Sastrawi

Result Will Be
Sentiment Distribution Pie Chart:

Displays percentages alongside counts for each sentiment (Positive, Negative, Neutral).

Source Type Distribution Bar Chart:

Shows counts and percentages for Media and Individual source types.

Word Cloud:

Generates a WordCloud for each sentiment (Positive, Negative, Neutral).

Top 10 Frequent Words:

Displays the top 10 frequent words for each sentiment with their percentages.

Expected Outputs:
Sentiment Distribution: Pie chart showing how sentiments are distributed.

Source Type Distribution: Bar chart showing Media vs Individual source counts and percentages.

Word Cloud: Displays the most frequent words for each sentiment.

Top 10 Frequent Words: Bar chart with word frequencies and their contribution to the total word count.

Next Steps:
Ensure the required resources (e.g., stopwords.txt, kamuskatabaku.xlsx, etc.) are in the data folder.

Run the script using:
