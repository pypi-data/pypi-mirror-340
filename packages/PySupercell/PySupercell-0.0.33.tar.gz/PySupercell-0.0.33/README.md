## Code citation

If you usage of this code lead to some publications, we request that you kindly cite it like

## Code distributions

* arguments: some arguments for command line
* QE_ibrav_lib: some defination of bravais lattice following Quantum ESPRESSO
* pysupercell: the core lib, with the class cryst_struct


## Installation
* Fast installation via pypi
pip install pysupercell


* Install manually from tarball 
1. Download the zip or tarball (tar.gz) of the package
2. unzip the package
3. Run one of the two following command
   python setup.py install --home=.
   python setup.py install --user

* To check whether you have successfully install the package, go to the python interactive shell
 
import pysupercell

  If everything runs smoothly, the installation should be done. 
  Contact the author if you come across any problem.

## Clean installation
./clean

This operation removes "build" and "dists" directories generated upon compilation
and results in the examples/tests_basic directory, including dat and ovf files, and figures in png


## Usage

* Use pysuerpcell as an API

    The major functions are collected in pysupercell.py library, as a cryst_struct class, to use it in your python script, use

    from pysupercell.pysupercell import cryst_struct

    Then you can create a instance of the class, for example, if you want to load structure from POSCAR, use

    struct = cryst_struct(file_poscar='POSCAR')

    struct.print_latt_param()


* Use pysupercell as an executable (python script)

    Some functionalities can be accessed via the pysc.py script under "bin" directory. Run

    pysc.py 

    to see the detailed description of usage

    Some other scirpts include

    v2qe: convert VASP POSCAR into Quantum ESPRESSO pwscf input

    qe2v:convert Quantum ESPRESSO pwscf input into VASP POSCAR (under test)

    match_latt: find matched superstructure for two layered structures
