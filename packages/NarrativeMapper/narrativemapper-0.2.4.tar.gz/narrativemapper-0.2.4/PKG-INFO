# NarrativeMapper


## Overview

Whether you're coding in Python or simply running a single command in your terminal, NarrativeMapper gives you instant insight into the dominant stories behind the noise.

Ever wonder what stories are dominating Reddit, Twitter, or any corner of the internet? NarrativeMapper clusters similar online discussions and uses OpenAI’s GPT to summarize the dominant narratives, tone, and sentiment. Built for researchers, journalists, analysts, and anyone trying to make sense of the chaos.

- Extracts dominant narratives from messy text data

- Clusters similar posts using embeddings + UMAP + HDBSCAN

- Summarizes each cluster with GPT

- Analyzes sentiment per narrative

- Plug-and-play pipeline: **CLI**, class-based, or functional

- Uses OpenAI Embeddings: [OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings)

- Preprocessing: L2 Normalization (for Euclidean distance) + [PCA](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.PCA.html)(to reduce UMAP memory usage) 

- Dimensionality reduction: [UMAP](https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

- Clustering: [HDBSCAN](https://hdbscan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

- Cluster Merging: Union-find algorithm

- Topic summary + sentiment extraction: [OpenAI's Chat Completions API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt), model gpt-4o-mini + [Hugging Face's distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english](https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english)

## How to Use

### Option 1: CLI (zero code)

Run NarrativeMapper directly from the terminal:

```bash
narrativemapper path/to/your.csv online_group_name
```
This will:

- Load the CSV

- Automatically embed, cluster, and summarize the comments

- Output a formatted results file in the current directory (output_summary.txt)

- Print the summarized narratives and sentiment to the terminal

```

- **verbose:** - Shows full verbose, including progress bars and cluster parameter values.

- **file-output:** - Outputs topic summaries to a file with *online_group_name*_NarrativeMapper.txt in working directory (like the above output example).
</details>

**Note:** Make sure you're running the CLI from the same directory where your .env file is located (Unless you have set OPENAI_API_KEY globally in your environment).

### Option 2: Class-Based Interface

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()

from narrative_mapper import *
import pandas as pd

file_df = pd.read_csv("file-path")

#initialize NarrativeMapper object
mapper = NarrativeMapper(file_df, "r/antiwork")

#embeds semantic vectors
mapper.load_embeddings()

#clustering: main UMAP and HDBSCAN variables along with kwargs for more customizability.
umap_kwargs =  {'min_dist': 0.0}
mapper.cluster(n_components=20, n_neighbors=20, min_cluster_size=40, min_samples=15, umap_kwargs=umap_kwargs)

#summarize each cluster's topic and sentiment
mapper.summarize(max_sample_size=500)

#export in your preferred format
summary_dict = mapper.format_to_dict()
text_df = mapper.format_by_text()
cluster_df = mapper.format_by_cluster()

#saving DataFrames to csv
text_df.to_csv("comments_by_cluster.csv", index=False)
cluster_df.to_csv("cluster_summary.csv", index=False)
```

### Option 3: Functional Interface

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()

from narrative_mapper import *
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("file-path")

#manual control over each step:
embeddings = get_embeddings(file_df)
cluster_df = cluster_embeddings(embeddings, n_components=20, n_neighbors=20, min_cluster_size=40, min_samples=15)
summary_df = summarize_clusters(cluster_df, max_sample_size=500)

#export/format options
summary_dict = format_to_dict(summary_df, online_group_name="r/antiwork")
text_df = format_by_text(summary_df, online_group_name="r/antiwork")
cluster_df = format_by_cluster(summary_df, online_group_name="r/antiwork")
```

## Output Formats

This example is based off of 1800 r/antiwork comments from the top 300 posts within the last year (Date of Writing: 2025-04-03).

The three formatter functions return the following:

**format_to_dict()** returns dict with following format:

cluster_embeddings(
    embeddings, 
    n_components=..., 
    n_neighbors=..., 
    min_cluster_size=..., 
    min_samples=..., 
    umap_kwargs=..., 
    hdbscan_kwags=...
    )

#Uses GPT (via Chat Completions) for cluster summaries and Hugging Face for sentiment analysis.
summarize_clusters(clustered_df, max_sample_size=...)

#Returns structured output as a dictionary (ideal for JSON export).
format_to_dict(summary_df)

#Returns a DataFrame where each row summarizes a cluster.
format_by_cluster(summary_df)

#Returns a DataFrame where each row is an individual comment with its sentiment and cluster label.

```

### Parameter Reference

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to expand</strong></summary>

- **n_components:** The number of dimensions UMAP reduces the embedding vectors to. Lower values simplify the data for clustering.

- **n_neighbors:** Influences UMAP’s balance between local and global structure. Higher values emphasize global relationships.

- **min_cluster_size:** In HDBSCAN, the minimum number of points required to form a cluster. Smaller values allow more granular clusters.

- **min_samples:** A density sensitivity parameter in HDBSCAN. Higher values make clustering more conservative.

- **umap_kwargs:** Allows for input of other UMAP parameters.

- **hdbscan_kwags:** Allows for input of other HDBSCAN parameters.

- **max_sample_size:** Maximum number of comments sampled per cluster for summarization.

</details>


## Estimated Cost (OpenAI Pricing)

Estimated cost: **$0.13 to $0.28 per 1 million tokens**.

Example: A CSV containing 1,000 Reddit comments costs approximately **$0.01** to process.

<details>
<summary><strong>Click for pricing details</strong></summary>

The OpenAI text-embedding-3-large model costs approximately $0.13 per 1 million input tokens. Determined by the total tokens of your input textual messages.

The Chat Completions model used for summarization (gpt-4o-mini) is $0.15 per 1 million input tokens. The max_sample_size parameter (referenced later) helps reduce costs by limiting how many comments are passed into gpt-4o-mini for each cluster. This can significantly reduce the Chat Completions token usage.

The gpt-4o-mini input prompt (excluding the text) and output summary are both very short (<100 tokens), so their cost contribution is negligible.
