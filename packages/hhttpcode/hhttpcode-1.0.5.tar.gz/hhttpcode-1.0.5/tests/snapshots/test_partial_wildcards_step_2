The response must include a WWW-Authenticate header field containing a challenge applicable to the requested resource. See Basic access authentication and Digest access authentication. 401 semantically means 'unauthorised', the user does not have valid authentication credentials for the target resource. Some sites incorrectly issue HTTP 401 when an IP address is banned from the website (usually the website domain) and that specific address is refused permission to access a website.[citation needed]"}, {"code": "402", "message": "Payment Required", "desc": "Reserved for future use. The original intention was that this code might be used as part of some form of digital cash or micropayment scheme, as proposed, for example, by GNU Taler, but that has not yet happened, and this code is not widely used. Google Developers API uses this status if a particular developer has exceeded the daily limit on requests. Sipgate uses this code if an account does not have sufficient funds to start a call. Shopify uses this code when the store has not paid their fees and is temporarily disabled. Stripe uses this code for failed payments where parameters were correct, for example blocked fraudulent payments."}, {"code": "403", "message": "Forbidden", "desc": "The request contained valid data and was understood by the server, but the server is refusing action. This may be due to the user not having the necessary permissions for a resource or needing an account of some sort, or attempting a prohibited action (e.g. creating a duplicate record where only one is allowed). This code is also typically used if the request provided authentication by answering the WWW-Authenticate header field challenge, but the server did not accept that authentication. The request should not be repeated."}, {"code": "404", "message": "Not Found", "desc": "The requested resource could not be found but may be available in the future. Subsequent requests by the client are permissible."}, {"code": "405", "message": "Method Not Allowed", "desc": "A request method is not supported for the requested resource; for example, a GET request on a form that requires data to be presented via POST, or a PUT request on a read-only resource."}, {"code": "406", "message": "Not Acceptable", "desc": "The requested resource is capable of generating only content not acceptable according to the Accept headers sent in the request.

This should be used when a resource has been intentionally removed and the resource should be purged. Upon receiving a 410 status code, the client should not request the resource in the future. Clients such as search engines should remove the resource from their indices. Most use cases do not require clients and search engines to purge the resource, and a '404 Not Found' may be used instead."}, {"code": "411", "message": "Length Required", "desc": "The request did not specify the length of its content, which is required by the requested resource."}, {"code": "412", "message": "Precondition Failed", "desc": "The server does not meet one of the preconditions that the requester put on the request header fields."}, {"code": "413", "message": "Payload Too Large", "desc": "The request is larger than the server is willing or able to process. Previously called 'Request Entity Too Large'."}, {"code": "414", "message": "URI Too Long", "desc": "The URI provided was too long for the server to process.

Called 'Request-URI Too Long' previously."}, {"code": "415", "message": "Unsupported Media Type", "desc": "The request entity has a media type which the server or resource does not support.

The RFC specifies this code should be returned by teapots requested to brew coffee. This HTTP status is used as an Easter egg in some websites, such as Google.com's 'I'm a teapot' easter egg. Sometimes, this status code is also used as a response to a blocked request, instead of the more appropriate 403 Forbidden."}, {"code": "421", "message": "Misdirected Request", "desc": "The request was directed at a server that is not able to produce a response (for example because of connection reuse)."}, {"code": "422", "message": "Unprocessable Content", "desc": "The request was well-formed (i.e., syntactically correct) but could not be processed."}, {"code": "423", "message": "Locked", "desc": "The resource that is being accessed is locked."}, {"code": "424", "message": "Failed Dependency", "desc": "The request failed because it depended on another request and that request failed (e.g., a PROPPATCH)."}, {"code": "425", "message": "Too Early", "desc": "Indicates that the server is unwilling to risk processing a request that might be replayed."}, {"code": "426", "message": "Upgrade Required", "desc": "The client should switch to a different protocol such as TLS/1.3, given in the Upgrade header field."}, {"code": "428", "message": "Precondition Required", "desc": "The origin server requires the request to be conditional.
