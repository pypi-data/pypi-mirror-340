          non-existent Account. A new skeleton Account will be automatically created.
          The usage data measurement is accepted and ingested as data belonging to the
          new auto-created Account. At a later date, you can edit the Account's
          Code,??Name, and??e-mail address. For more details, see
          [Submittting Usage Data for Non-Existent Accounts](https://www.m3ter.com/docs/guides/billing-and-usage-data/submitting-usage-data/submitting-usage-data-for-non-existent-accounts)
          in our main documentation.
        - **Usage Data Adjustments.** If you need to make corrections for billing
          retrospectively against an Account, you can use date/time values in the past
          for the `ts` (timestamp) request parameter to submit positive or negative
          usage data amounts to correct and reconcile earlier billing anomalies. For
          more details, see
          [Submittting Usage Data Adjustments Using Timestamp](https://www.m3ter.com/docs/guides/billing-and-usage-data/submitting-usage-data/submitting-usage-data-adjustments-using-timestamp)
          in our main documentation.
        - **Ingest Validation Failure Events.** After the intial submission of a usage
          data measurement to the Ingest API, a data enrichment stage is performed to
          check for any errors in the usage data measurement, such as a missing field.
          If an error is identified, this might result in the submission being rejected.
          In these cases, an _ingest validation failure_ Event is generated, which you
          can review on the
          [Ingest Events](https://www.m3ter.com/docs/guides/billing-and-usage-data/submitting-usage-data/reviewing-and-resolving-ingest-events)
          page in the Console. See also the

          Reference.

        Identifiable Information (PII) in m3ter is restricted to a few fields on the

          The usage data measurement is accepted and ingested as data belonging to the
          new auto-created Account. At a later date, you can edit the Account's
          Code,??Name, and??e-mail address. For more details, see
          [Submittting Usage Data for Non-Existent Accounts](https://www.m3ter.com/docs/guides/billing-and-usage-data/submitting-usage-data/submitting-usage-data-for-non-existent-accounts)
          in our main documentation.
        - **Usage Data Adjustments.** If you need to make corrections for billing
          retrospectively against an Account, you can use date/time values in the past
          for the `ts` (timestamp) request parameter to submit positive or negative
          usage data amounts to correct and reconcile earlier billing anomalies. For
          more details, see
          [Submittting Usage Data Adjustments Using Timestamp](https://www.m3ter.com/docs/guides/billing-and-usage-data/submitting-usage-data/submitting-usage-data-adjustments-using-timestamp)
          in our main documentation.
        - **Ingest Validation Failure Events.** After the intial submission of a usage
          data measurement to the Ingest API, a data enrichment stage is performed to
          check for any errors in the usage data measurement, such as a missing field.
          If an error is identified, this might result in the submission being rejected.
          In these cases, an _ingest validation failure_ Event is generated, which you
          can review on the
          [Ingest Events](https://www.m3ter.com/docs/guides/billing-and-usage-data/submitting-usage-data/reviewing-and-resolving-ingest-events)
          page in the Console. See also the
          [Events](https://www.m3ter.com/docs/api#tag/Events) section in this API
          Reference.

        **IMPORTANT! - Use of PII:** The use of any of your end-customers' Personally
        Identifiable Information (PII) in m3ter is restricted to a few fields on the
        **Account** entity. Please ensure that any measurements you submit do not
        contain any end-customer PII data. See the
        [Introduction section](https://www.m3ter.com/docs/api#section/Introduction)
        above for more details.
