# odatse-XAFS: solver module for analyses of PTRF-XAFS spectrum data

Polarization-dependent Total Reflection Fluorescence X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (PTRF-XAFS) is a method to analyze material structures by the X-ray absorption spectra that reveal symmetries or electronic states of atoms. Especially, by using the total reflection, it is efficient for the analysis of surface structure.

[Open Data Analysis Tool for Science and Engineering (ODAT-SE)](https://github.com/issp-center-dev/ODAT-SE) provides a framework for applying a search algorithm to a direct problem solver to find the optimal solution. It has been developed by the name 2DMAT, and since version 3.0, it is organized as an open platform for data analysis by modularizing direct problem solvers and search algorithms.

For the analysis of X-ray spectra, a first-principle calculation software, [FEFF](https://feff.phys.washington.edu/), has been developed that provides theoretical prediction of X-ray spectroscopy from the information of atomic positions. odatse-XAFS is an adaptor library to use FEFF as a direct problem solver of ODAT-SE.

## Prerequisites

- Required
  - python >= 3.9
  - numpy >= 1.14
  - pydantic >= 2.0
  - ODAT-SE >= 3.0
  - FEFF 8.5 light, or later

## Install

- From PyPI (Recommended)
  - `python3 -m pip install -U odatse-XAFS`
    - If you install them locally, use `--user` option like `python3 -m pip install -U --user`
- From Source (For developers)
  1. update `pip >= 19` by `python3 -m pip install -U pip`
  2. `python3 -m pip install ODATSE_XAFS_ROOT_DIRECTORY` to install `odatse-XAFS` package and `odatse-XAFS` command
    - `ODATSE_XAFS_ROOT_DIRECTORY` means the directory including this `README.md` file.

## Simple Usage

- `odatse-XAFS input.toml` (use the installed script)
- `python3 src/main.py input.toml` (use the raw script)
- For details of the input file, see the document.
