# CSM Python API Library

## Installation

```
# from PyPI
pip install csm-ai

# from source
pip install git+https://github.com/CommonSenseMachines/csm-ai.git
```

## Usage

Initialize the API client:

```python
from csm import CSMClient

# NOTE: replace with a valid API key
csm_client = CSMClient(api_key='6bCfF4467bXXXXXX4E6B271BeC5')
```

Run an `image-to-3d` job:

```python
# input a local image path (also supported: url, PIL.Image.Image)
image_path = "/path/to/image.png"
result = csm_client.image_to_3d(image_path, mesh_format='glb')

print(result.mesh_path)
```

Run a `text-to-3d` job:

```python
prompt = "3d asset of a character head, cartoon style, low poly, front view"
result = csm_client.text_to_3d(prompt, mesh_format='obj')

print(result.mesh_path)
```

**Mesh formats:** Choose any of ['obj', 'glb', 'fbx', 'usdz'] for the `mesh_format` argument.

**Verbose mode:** Run client functions with option `verbose=True` (the default) to see additional status messages and logs.
