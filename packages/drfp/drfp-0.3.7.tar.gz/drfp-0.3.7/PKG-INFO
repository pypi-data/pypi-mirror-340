# DRFP


An NLP-inspired chemical reaction fingerprint based on basic set arithmetic.

## Description

Predicting the nature and outcome of reactions using computational methods is an important tool to accelerate chemical research. The recent application of deep learning-based learned fingerprints to reaction classification and reaction yield prediction has shown an impressive increase in performance compared to previous methods such as DFT- and structure-based fingerprints. However, learned fingerprints require large training data sets, are inherently biased, and are based on complex deep learning architectures. Here we present the differential reaction fingerprint *DRFP*. The *DRFP* algorithm takes a reaction SMILES as an input and creates a binary fingerprint based on the symmetric difference of two sets containing the circular molecular n-grams generated from the molecules listed left and right from the reaction arrow, respectively, without the need for distinguishing between reactants and reagents. We show that *DRFP* outperforms DFT-based fingerprints in reaction yield prediction and other structure-based fingerprints in reaction classification, and reaching the performance of state-of-the-art learned fingerprints in both tasks while being data-independent.

## Getting Started
The best way to start exploring DRFP is on binder.
A notebook that gets you started on creating and using DRFP:

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/reymond-group/drfp/HEAD?filepath=notebooks%2F01_fingerprinting.ipynb)

A notbook that explains how you can use SHAP to analyse and interpret your machine learning models when using DRFP:

## Installation and Usage
*DRFP* can be installed from pypi using `pip install drfp`.

Once DRFP is installed, there are two ways you can use it. You can use the cli app `drfp` or the library provided by the package.

### CLI
```bash
drfp my_rxn_smiles.txt my_rxn_fps.pkl -d 512
```

This will create a pickle dump containing an numpy ndarray containing DRFP fingerprints with a dimensionality of 512. To also export the mapping, use the flag `--mapping`. This will create the additional file `my_rxn_fps.map.pkl`. You can call `drfp --help` to show all available flags and options.

### Library
Following is a basic exmple of how to use DRFP in a Python script.
```python
from drfp import DrfpEncoder

rxn_smiles = [
    "CO.O[C@@H]1CCNC1.[C-]#[N+]CC(=O)OC>>[C-]#[N+]CC(=O)N1CC[C@@H](O)C1",
    "CCOC(=O)C(CC)c1cccnc1.Cl.O>>CCC(C(=O)O)c1cccnc1",
]

fps = DrfpEncoder.encode(rxn_smiles)
```

The variable `fps` now points to a list containing the fingerprints for the two reaction SMILES as numpy arrays.


## Documentation

The library contains the class `DrfpEncoder` with one public method `encode`.
