`spinspg` is a Python package for detecting spin space group on top of `spglib`

- Document(latest): <https://spinspg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>
- GitHub: <https://github.com/spglib/spinspg>
- PyPI: <https://pypi.org/project/spinspg/>

## Features

- Find spin symmetry operations from spin arrangements

## Usage

{func}`spinspg.get_spin_symmetry` returns spin symmetry operations of a given spin arrangement, analogous to Spglib's {ref}`spglib:py_get_magnetic_symmetry` for magnetic symmetry operations.
For comprehensive output details, refer to [API documents](docs/api/api.md).

```python
import numpy as np
from spinspg import get_spin_symmetry

# Antiferromagnetic rutile structure
a = 4.87
c = 3.31
x_4f = 0.695169
lattice = np.diag([a, a, c])
positions = np.array([  # Fractional coordinates
    [0, 0, 0],  # Mn(2a)
    [0.5, 0.5, 0.5],  # Mn(2a)
    [x_4f, x_4f, 0],  # F(4f)
    [-x_4f, -x_4f, 0],  # F(4f)
    [-x_4f + 0.5, x_4f + 0.5, 0.5],  # F(4f)
    [x_4f + 0.5, -x_4f + 0.5, 0.5],  # F(4f)
])
numbers = np.array([0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1])
magmoms = np.array([  # In Cartesian coordinates
    [0, 0, 2.5],
    [0, 0, -2.5],
    [0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0],
])

# Find spin symmetry operations
sog, rotations, translations, spin_rotations = get_spin_symmetry(lattice, positions, numbers, magmoms)

print(f"Spin-only group: {sog}")  # COLLINEAR(axis=[0. 0. 1.])

# Some operations have nontrivial spin rotations
idx = 2
print(f"Rotation ({idx})\n{rotations[idx]}")
print(f"Translation ({idx})\n{translations[idx]}")
print(f"Spin rotation ({idx})\n{spin_rotations[idx]}")  # -> diag([1, 1, -1])
```

## Installation

```shell
pip install spinspg
```
