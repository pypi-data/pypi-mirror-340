            You are an evaluator of thinking process management quality.
            Analyze the following statement and rate how well it demonstrates control over the thinking process.

            Thinking process management includes:
            - Setting or clarifying goals
            - Planning next thinking steps
            - Coordinating different thinking styles (e.g. facts, emotions, critique)
            - Summarizing progress or directing attention
            - Keeping the brainstorming session structured and focused

            Rate the statement on a scale from 0 (not managing thinking at all) to 10 (very clearly managing the thinking process).
            Be strict and fair.
