## 🛠️ Installation

Install Shellviz with pip:

```

## 🔧 Getting Started

## Basic Usage
```python
from shellviz import log, table, json

log('my first shellviz command')
# Shellviz serving on http://127.0.0.1:5544

table([("Alice", 25, 5.6), ("Bob", 30, 5.9)])
json({"name": "Alice", "age": 25, "height": 5.6})
```
Open the generated URL in your browser, and you’ll see your data visualized instantly.

### Advanced Usage

**Update Existing Values**
```python
from shellviz import progress
progress(0.0, id='migration')
progress(1.0, id='migration') # Update data dynamically
```

**Append Data**
```python
from shellviz import table

table([('Joe', 10)], id='users')
table([('Jane', 12)], id='users', append=True)
```

**Clear Logs**
```python
from shellviz import clear
clear()
```
**Second-Screen via QR Code**

show_qr_code()
```

## 🏗️ Contributing

We welcome contributions! If you encounter issues or have ideas, feel free to submit an issue or pull request on GitHub.

### Developing client side code
Client-side code is written in React using the `create-react-app` boilerplate. To set up the client side environment, run the following

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm start
```

This should launch a live-updating browser window that will listen for traffic on the default Shellviz websocket port

### Build
Bundling and deploying Shellviz is straightforward. Run the following command to build a compiled version of the Shellviz client that will be placed in the package's `build` folder:

```bash
cd client
npm run build
```

Once this is done, you can compile the package using poetry:
```bash
cd .. # jump to project root
poetry build
```
To install into a local python environment, run the following command:

```bash
poetry add --no-cache ~/[path-to-repo]/dist/shellviz-0.x.x-py3-none-any.whl
```
