# penaltyblog: Football Data & Modelling Made Easy

penaltyblog is a production-ready Python toolkit for football analytics ‚Äî built for speed, clarity, and real-world impact.

## Features
- ‚öΩ **Scrape Data** ‚Äì Collect match statistics from sources like FBRef, Understat, Club Elo, and Fantasy Premier League.
- üìä **Model Matches Efficiently** ‚Äì High-performance implementations of Poisson, Bivariate Poisson, Dixon-Coles, and other advanced statistical models, optimized with Cython for rapid analysis.
- üí∞ **Bet Smarter** ‚Äì Precisely estimate probabilities for Asian handicaps, over/under totals, match outcomes, and more.
- üèÜ **Rank Teams** ‚Äì Evaluate team strengths with sophisticated methods including Elo, Massey, Colley, and Pi ratings.
- üìà **Decode Bookmaker Odds** ‚Äì Accurately extract implied probabilities by removing bookmaker margins (overrounds).
- üéØ **Fantasy Football Optimisation** ‚Äì Mathematically optimize your fantasy football squad to maximize performance.

Take your football analytics and betting strategy to the next level with **penaltyblog** üöÄ

## Why Penaltyblog?

Unlike many football analytics resources that are academic, one-off, or hard to scale, `penaltyblog` is designed from the ground up to be **production-ready**, **performance-optimized**, and **practically useful**.

It combines advanced statistical models, efficient implementations (via **Cython**), and real-world workflows ‚Äî from scraping public data to modelling outcomes and optimising fantasy teams.

Built by [Martin Eastwood](https://pena.lt/y/about), who has worked with football clubs, governing bodies, and player agencies worldwide, `penaltyblog` is a foundation for real decision-making in football analytics.

Whether you're a club analyst, independent researcher, or just data-curious, `penaltyblog` gives you the tools to go from data to insight ‚Äî fast, flexibly, and with confidence.

## Support & Collaboration

If you're working at a football club, agency, or organisation and want help applying these tools to your own data or workflows, I'm open to:

- üìÇ Integration support
- üîß Custom model development
- üß† Technical collaboration on football analytics projects
