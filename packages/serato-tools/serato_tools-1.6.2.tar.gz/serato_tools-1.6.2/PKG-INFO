# Serato Tags

This repository aims to document the GEOB ID3 tags that the Serato DJ software uses to store its metadata.
You can also have a look at [this lengthy blog post](https://homepage.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/jan.holthuis/posts/reversing-seratos-geob-tags) that goes into detail how I reversed the contents of the `Serato Markers2` GEOB tag.

The different file/tag formats that Serato uses to store the information are documented in [`docs/fileformats.md`](docs/fileformats.md), a script to dump the tag data can be found at [`scripts/tagdump.py`](scripts/tagdump.py).
