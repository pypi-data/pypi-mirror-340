# VVPET DOCUMENTATION

**vvpet** is your personal pet, kinda like tamagochi

## How to run

The game itself is started using the `game()` function, hidden inside `vvpet_main`

Therefore to run, you need the following:
```
from vvpet import vvpet_main

vvpet_main.game()
```

(or name it as whatever alias you want, just run the function)

## Basic usage

>As of version 0.5.0, the game features a save/load system that creates new files in the same directory from which the game runs, letting
you save your games. Do not edit nor delete the files if you don't want to lose the data (duh)

### How the game functions

#### Commands

The game has 2 types of commands, `Utility` and `Action`.

`Utility` commands are used to track / display information about your pet, and resources used in-game

`Action` commands interact directly with the "world", some causing `ticks` to happen

`Tick` is a unit of time, during which your pet loses some of their resources

The list of available commands is stated below

The main gameloop revolves around getting money in order to buy food and enrichment for your pet

#### Resources

You have several resources to keep track of, the main being your `money`. You start each game with a 100

The next few are `pet` resources.

`hunger`,
`thirst`,
and `fun` all function on a similiar basis, being replenished directly through food, or enrichment. 

`health` starts at 10, and gets lowered when either of the 3 basic resources are depleted

`mood` is the final "resource", deriving from the mentioned 4, but only serving as a general look into the
wellbeing of your pet

### In-game commands

>There is a `help` command in-game, this list is just more comprehensive

#### Utility

`stats` is the most basic and most frequented command, displaying your pet's resources

`balance` shows your current money balance

`inventory` lists your inventory contents

`mood` displays the overall mood of your pet

`save` and `load` do exacty what they sound like they do. You can save/load mid-game

#### Actions

>The following three commands do not cause a `tick` to happen

`shop` is the main place to spend your money. Bought items go directly into your inventory.

`feed` enables you to feed your pet, from your inventory.

`pet` is the simplest and cheapest (free) way to gain `fun`

--

`work` is the boring way to get money, gaining from 10 to 20 `money`

`casino`, or `gamble` is the *fun* way to get money. Currently, there are 2 games to choose from

- `roulette`, marked in-game as `1` is the classic game, enabling you to bet either on a color or number. Color nets you `bet * 2`, where Number nets you `bet * 4`

- `blackjack`, marked in-game as `2` is the game granting you the illusion of manipulating your chances. After betting, you get a chance to either `hit`, or `pass`. Your goal is to get as close to `21` as possible. After `pass`, the dealer makes his moves. Whoever overshoots, or is further away from `21`, loses. It nets you `bet * 2`


`end`, or `exit` is the safe way to exit your game. You get a choice to `save` your game before the code exits.

#### Admintools

`admin.tick` is a command letting you force a tick to happen
