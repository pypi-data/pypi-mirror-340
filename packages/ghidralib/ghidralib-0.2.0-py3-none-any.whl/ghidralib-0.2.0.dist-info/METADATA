# ghidralib

![](./docs/dragon1.png)

This library is an attempt to provide a Pythonic standard library for Ghidra.

The main goal is to make writing quick&dirty scripts actually quick, and not that dirty.

## Installation

Just copy the [ghidralib.py](https://github.com/msm-code/ghidralib/blob/master/ghidralib.py) file to your ghidra_scripts directory.
Later just `from ghidralib import *`.

## Usage

Check out the [documentation](https://msm-code.github.io/ghidralib/) or official [examples](./examples/).
A short demonstration of a basic ghidralib usage first:

1. Get all function instructions (similarly for basic blocks, low and high pcode, calls and xrefs):

```python
print(Function("main").instructions)
```

<details>
  <summary>For comparison, plain Ghidra equivalent:</summary>

  ```python
  function_manager = currentProgram.getFunctionManager()
  symbol_table = currentProgram.getSymbolTable()
  main = list(symbol_table.getSymbols('main'))[0].getAddress()
  function = function_manager.getFunctionAt(main)
  instructions = currentProgram.getListing().getInstructions(function.getBody(), True)
  print(list(instructions))
  ```
</details>

2. You have a structure `uint8_t *data; uint32_t len;` at 0x1000 and you want to read it:

```python
pos, len_bytes = get_u32(0x10000), get_u32(0x10000 + 4)
print(get_bytes(pos, len_bytes))
```

<details>
  <summary>For comparison, plain Ghidra equivalent:</summary>

  ```python
  start_address = toAddr(0x10000)
  pos = currentProgram.getMemory().getInt(start_address)
  len_bytes = currentProgram.getMemory().getInt(start_address.add(4))
  data = getBytes(toAddr(pos), len_bytes)
  print(" ".join(chr(c % 256) for byte in data))  # signed bytes <3
  ```
</details>

3. Find all calls to a string deobfuscation function and get call parameters:

```python
for call in Function("MyCustomCrypto").calls:
    ctx = call.infer_context()
    key, data = ctx["eax"], ctx["edx"]
    datalen = get_u32(data - 4)
    print(call.address, decode(get_bytes(data, datalen)))
```

<details>
  <summary>For comparison, plain Ghidra equivalent:</summary>

  Just joking! Too long to fit in this README.
</details>

You can also emulate a function call and read the result:

```python
ctx = Function("GetFuncNameByHash").emulate(0x698766968)
print(ctx.read_cstring(ctx["eax"]))
```

4. Tons more QoL features:

```python
DataType("_NT_TIB")  # Get a datatype by name
DataType.from_c("typedef void* HINTERNET;")  # Quickly parse structs and typedefs

func = Function("main")  # Work at various abstract levels
print(function.instructions)  # Get instructions...
print(function.basicblocks)  # ..basic blocks...
print(function.pcode)  # ...low pcode...
print(function.high_pcode)  # ...high pcode...
print(function.decompile())  # ...or decompile a whole function

for xref in Symbol("PTR_GetProcAddress").xrefs_to:
  Instruction(xref.from_address).highlight()  # highlight symbol xrefs
```

5. There are also some flashy (but not necessarily useful) features that might
grab your attention.

Get the control flow graph of the main function, and display it:

```python
Function("main").control_flow.show()
```

![](./docs/graph.png)

Find the shortest path from source to target in the program control flow graph.
If it exists, highlight all basic blocks along the way.

```python
source, target = BasicBlock("entry"), BasicBlock(0x00405073)
path = Program.control_flow().bfs(source)
while path.get(target):
    target.highlight()
    target = path[target]
```

6. Thanks to type hints, scripting gets *much* easier if your IDE supports that.

Finally, ghidralib doesn't lock you in - you can always retreat to familiar Ghidra types -
just get them from the `.raw` property. For example `instruction.raw`
is a Ghidra Instruction object, similarly `function.raw` is a Ghidra Function.
So you can do the routine stuff in ghidralib, and fall back to Java if something
is not implemented.

## Learn more

**Check out the [documentation](https://msm-code.github.io/ghidralib/)**, especially the
[getting started](https://msm-code.github.io/ghidralib/getting_started/) page.

More detailed tutorial about specific features is in development. Completed chapters:

* [Emulator](https://msm-code.github.io/ghidralib/emulator/)

If you prefer to learn by example, you can also browse the [examples](./examples/) directory.

A fair warning: ghidralib is still actively developed and the API may change
slightly in the future. But this doesn't matter for your one-off scripts, does it?

## Contributing

PRs are welcome. Feel free to open PRs to add things you need.

You can also just report issues and send feature requests. I started this library to
cover my own needs, but I'm interested in learning what other people use it for.
