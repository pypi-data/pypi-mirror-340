`django-email-relay` enables Django projects without direct access to a preferred SMTP server to use that server for email dispatch.

It consists of two parts:

1. A Django app with a custom email backend that stores emails in a central database queue. This is what you will use on all the distributed Django projects that you would like to give access to the preferred SMTP server.

2. A relay service that reads from this queue to orchestrate email sending. It is available as either a standalone Docker image or a management command to be used within a Django project that does have access to the preferred SMTP server.
