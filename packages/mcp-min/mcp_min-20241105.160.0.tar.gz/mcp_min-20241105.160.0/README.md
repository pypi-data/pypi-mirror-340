# MCP min

A minimal Model Context Protocol Python SDK.

Based upon the [official Python MCP SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk) (version 1.6.0).

The main rationale behind this package is to provide MCP utilities without any extra dependency other than Pydantic. Thus, when compared to the official SDK, this package mainly provides types and abstract classes only.

Given the minimal amount of changes compared to the official SDK code, this project is licensed under the original MIT License - see the LICENSE file for details.
