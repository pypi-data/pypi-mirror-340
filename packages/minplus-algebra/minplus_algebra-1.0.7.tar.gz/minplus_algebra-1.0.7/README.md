# MinPlus-Algebra
MinPlus-algebra is a way to abandon non-linear operations and switch to linear ones.
The addition operation is replaced by the infimum operation. The multiplication operation is replaced by the addition operation.
This approach is actively used in [Network Calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_calculus).

In MinPlus algebra, there are 3 basic operations for processing functions and combinations of functions: Convolution, Sub-Add Closure and Deconvolution. You can see examples of function handling below:
