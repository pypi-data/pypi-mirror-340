Maintained fork of libcpab for PyTorch.

Install with `pip`: `pip install libcpab`

This fork of [libcpab](https://github.com/SkafteNicki/libcpab):

- Removes numpy and tensorflow backends to only allow pytorch;
- Simplifies file structure;
- Maintenance: remove deprecated numpy and scipy dependencies and update to latest functions.

Requirements remain as `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib` and `pytorch`.
