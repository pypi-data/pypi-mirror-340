# wass2s: A python-based tool for seasonal climate forecast

![Modules in WAS_S2S](./modules.png)

**wass2s** is a comprehensive tool developed to enhance the accuracy and reproducibility of seasonal forecasts in West Africa and the Sahel. This initiative aligns with the World Meteorological Organization's (WMO) guidelines for objective, operational, and scientifically rigorous seasonal forecasting methods.


## Overview
The wass2s tool is designed to facilitate the generation of seasonal forecasts using various statistical and machine learning methods including the Exploration of AI methods. 
It helps forecaster to download data, build models, verify the models, and forecast. A user-friendly jupyter-lab notebook streaming the process of prevision.

## üöÄ Features

- ‚úÖ **Automated Forecasting**: Streamlines the seasonal forecasting process, reducing manual interventions.
- üîÑ **Reproducibility**: Ensures that forecasts can be consistently reproduced and evaluated.
- üìä **Modularity**: Highly modular tool. Users can easily customize and extend the tool to meet their specific needs.
- ü§ñ **Exploration of AI and Machine Learning**: Investigates the use of advanced technologies to further improve forecasting accuracy.
