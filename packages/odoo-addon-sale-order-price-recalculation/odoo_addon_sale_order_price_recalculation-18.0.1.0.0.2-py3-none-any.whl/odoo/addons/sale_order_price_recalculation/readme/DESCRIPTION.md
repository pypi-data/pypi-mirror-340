This module adds 2 buttons on sale orders (below sale order lines) that:

- Recalculates the prices of the order lines that contain a product in
  them.
- Reset product descriptions from current product information.

It is launched manually as a button to get the user  to decide if they
want to recalculate prices when the pricelist is changed or, after
duplicating a sale order, wether to update sales information or not.
