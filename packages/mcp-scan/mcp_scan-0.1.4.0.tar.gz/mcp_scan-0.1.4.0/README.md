# MCP-Scan: An MCP Security Scanner

## Overview
MCP-Scan is a tool designed to iterate through your installed MCP servers and check them for common [prompt-injection-based security vulnerabilities](https://invariantlabs.ai/blog/mcp-security-notification-tool-poisoning-attacks).

## Quick Start
To run MCP-Scan, use the following command:

```bash
uvx mcp-scan@latest
```

### Example Output
```bash
(base)
% uvx mcp-scan@latest
scanning ~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json found 0 servers

scanning ~/.cursor/mcp.json found 5 servers

## How It Works
MCP-Scan searches through your configuration files to find MCP server configurations. It connects to these servers and retrieves tool descriptions.

The scans are conducted both locally and via an invariantlabs.ai server. Tool names and descriptions are sent to invariantlabs.ai and stored there. By using MCP-Scan, you agree to the invariantlabs.ai [terms of use](https://explorer.invariantlabs.ai/terms) and [privacy policy](https://invariantlabs.ai/privacy-policy).

## Development Setup
To run this package from source, follow these steps:

```
uv init
uv run pip install -e .
uv run -m src.mcp_scan
```
