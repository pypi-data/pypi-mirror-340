Overview
--------

**Purem** is an advanced high-performance computational library optimized for vectorized mathematical operations. This project focuses on efficient execution of element-wise transformations, including ``softmax``, ``exp``, and other mathematical functions, leveraging highly optimized assembly code for modern architectures.

Key Features
------------

Purem is a blazing-fast AI math engine that turns your Python formulas into native-speed vectorized execution.
Achieve up to 80× faster performance on CPU/GPU/TPU — no rewrites, no dependencies, just speed.
Designed for ML researchers, scientific computing, and production-grade workloads that can’t afford to wait.

---

🔧 Installation
---------------

Install the Python wrapper via pip::

    pip install purem

📦 **Note:** Installation is quick, but ``purem`` must be initialized with a license before use.
Setup takes less than a minute – we’re ready when you are: https://worktif.com/#start

---

🚀 Quickstart
-------------

1. Import and Initialize::

    from purem import purem

    purem.configure(license_key='your-license-key')  # Auto-downloads and configures backend

Alternatively, if you already have the backend ``.so`` file::

    from purem import purem

    purem.softmax([...])  # Initialized from local ./lib/libpurem.so

---

📁 Local Library Structure
---------------------------

If the backend ``.so`` is already downloaded manually, place it here::

    your_project/
    ├── main.py
    ├── lib/
    │   └── libpurem.so

---

🔐 License-Based Activation
----------------------------

To automatically download and configure the backend library:

1. Call ``purem.configure(license_key='<your-license-key>')``
2. The system will download the ``.so`` file to ``./lib/``
3. All functions will become available instantly after initialization

Without a valid license key:

- No ``.so`` will be downloaded
- The library won't work unless you provide the ``.so`` manually

---

🧠 Available Functions
-----------------------

After initialization, you can call::

    from purem import purem

    purem.softmax([...])
    ...

📦 Packaging Notes
-------------------

This package does **not** bundle the ``.so`` file. You are required to:

- Use a license key to download it dynamically
- Alternatively, place it manually into ``./lib/`` folder before calling ``init()``

📧 Distribution and Licensing
------------------------------

We **do not provide direct download links** for the backend.
All users must either:

- Use their license key to install
- Or receive ``.so`` file from verified sources

📚 Full Example
----------------

.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    from purem import purem

    # Automatic setup using license key
    try:
        purem.configure(license_key='<your-license-key>')
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Setup failed: {e}")

    data = np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], dtype=float)
    output = purem.softmax(data)

    print(output)
