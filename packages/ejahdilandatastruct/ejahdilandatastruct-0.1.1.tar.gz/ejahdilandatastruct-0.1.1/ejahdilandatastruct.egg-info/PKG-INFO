# Ejah Data Structures Python Package

Ejah Data Structures is a Python package that provides various data structures with common operations such as insert, delete, search, and traverse. This package includes implementations of the following data structures: Array, Binary Search Tree, Binary Graph Search, Singly Linked List, Queue, and Stack.

## Installation

To install the Ejah Data Structures Python package, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can install the package using `pip`:

```bash
pip install ejah-data-structures
```

Make sure you run this command within a Python environment.

## Clone the Repository

To clone this repository to your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Run the following command on your terminal to clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/EjahDil/data-structures-python.git
    ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd data-structures-python
    ```

## Features

This package includes the following data structures, each with its own module containing methods for insert, delete, search, traverse, and more:

### Array

The `Array` class provides a dynamic array implementation with operations to insert, delete, search, and traverse the array.

#### Methods

- **Insert(index, value)**: Adds an element at a specified index.
- **Delete(index)**: Removes an element from a given index.
- **Search(value)**: Searches for an element and returns its index.
- **Traverse()**: Returns all elements in the array.
- **Length()**: Returns the number of elements in the array.
- **Is Empty()**: Checks if the array is empty.


### Binary Graph Search

The `BinaryGraphSearch` class allows for binary search on a sorted list of data. This class implements both the search operation and the insert operation to maintain the list in sorted order.

#### Methods

- **Search(target)**: Searches for a target element using binary search.
- **Insert(value)**: Inserts a value into the list while maintaining the sorted order.
- **In-order Traversal()**: Simulates an in-order traversal of the binary tree (which is essentially the sorted list).

### Binary Search Tree

The `BinarySearchTree` class implements a binary search tree, which allows for efficient searching, insertion, and traversal of nodes in sorted order.

#### Methods

- **Insert(data)**: Inserts a node with the given data.
- **Search(data)**: Searches for a node with the specified data.
- **In-order Traversal()**: Returns the nodes in sorted order (in-order traversal).


### Singly Linked List

The `SinglyLinkedList` class provides a basic singly linked list implementation.

#### Methods

- **Insert(data)**: Adds a new node at the end of the list.
- **Delete(data)**: Removes a node with the specified value.
- **Search(data)**: Searches for a node containing a specific value.
- **Traverse()**: Returns a list of all nodes' data.

### Queue

The `Queue` class implements a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) structure, which is useful for scenarios like task scheduling.

#### Methods

- **Enqueue(item)**: Adds an item to the end of the queue.
- **Dequeue()**: Removes and returns the front item from the queue.
- **Peek()**: Returns the front item without removing it.
- **Is Empty()**: Checks if the queue is empty.

### Stack

The `Stack` class implements a LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) structure, which is essential for undo operations, function calls, and parsing expressions.

#### Methods

- **Push(item)**: Adds an item to the top of the stack.
- **Pop()**: Removes and returns the top item from the stack.
- **Peek()**: Returns the top item without removing it.
- **Is Empty()**: Checks if the stack is empty.

Usage
After installation, you can start using the package by importing the classes directly into your Python code.

## Usage
