    <h2>Documentation</h2>
    <div>Basically there are only 2 submodules Studio and Compiler. Consider both:></div>
    <div>
        <h2>Studio</h2>
        <div>A more interesting module, as it allows you to create virtual machines with an open 5000 port with the VS Code interface in 5300  port. The request goes through OneCompiler.Studio. It has only 7 methods. Getting a list of machine/machines, creating, deleting, and getting a list of templates. See the tests as an example.</div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Compiler</h2>
        <div>A regular compiler for programming languages, nothing remarkable. It has only 1 method exec:> The receiving list is the file name and its contents, See the tests as an example.</div>
