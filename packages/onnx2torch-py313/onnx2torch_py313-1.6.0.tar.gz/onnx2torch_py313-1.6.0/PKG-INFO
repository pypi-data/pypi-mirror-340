           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the

           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

onnx2torch is an ONNX to PyTorch converter.
Our converter:

- Is easy to use – Convert the ONNX model with the function call `convert`;
- Is easy to extend – Write your own custom layer in PyTorch and register it with `@add_converter`;
- Convert back to ONNX – You can convert the model back to ONNX using the `torch.onnx.export` function.

If you find an issue, please [let us know](https://github.com/ENOT-AutoDL/onnx2torch/issues)!
And feel free to create merge requests.

Please note that this converter covers only a limited number of PyTorch / ONNX models and operations.
Let us know which models you use or want to convert from ONNX to PyTorch [here](https://github.com/ENOT-AutoDL/onnx2torch/discussions).

## Installation

```bash
pip install onnx2torch
```

or

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge onnx2torch
```

## Usage

Below you can find some examples of use.

### Convert

```python
import onnx
import torch
from onnx2torch import convert

# Path to ONNX model
onnx_model_path = "/some/path/mobile_net_v2.onnx"
# You can pass the path to the onnx model to convert it or...
torch_model_1 = convert(onnx_model_path)

# Or you can load a regular onnx model and pass it to the converter
onnx_model = onnx.load(onnx_model_path)
torch_model_2 = convert(onnx_model)
```

### Execute

We can execute the returned `PyTorch model` in the same way as the original torch model.

```python
import onnxruntime as ort

# Create example data
x = torch.ones((1, 2, 224, 224)).cuda()

out_torch = torch_model_1(x)

ort_sess = ort.InferenceSession(onnx_model_path)
outputs_ort = ort_sess.run(None, {"input": x.numpy()})

# Check the Onnx output against PyTorch
print(torch.max(torch.abs(outputs_ort - out_torch.detach().numpy())))
print(np.allclose(outputs_ort, out_torch.detach().numpy(), atol=1.0e-7))
```

## How to add new operations to converter

Here we show how to extend onnx2torch with new ONNX operation, that supported by both PyTorch and ONNX

<details>
<summary>and has the same behaviour</summary>

An example of such a module is [Relu](./onnx2torch/node_converters/activations.py)

```python
@add_converter(operation_type="Relu", version=6)
@add_converter(operation_type="Relu", version=13)
@add_converter(operation_type="Relu", version=14)
def _(node: OnnxNode, graph: OnnxGraph) -> OperationConverterResult:
    return OperationConverterResult(
        torch_module=nn.ReLU(),
        onnx_mapping=onnx_mapping_from_node(node=node),
    )
```

Here we have registered an operation named `Relu` for opset versions 6, 13, 14.
Note that the `torch_module` argument in `OperationConverterResult` must be a torch.nn.Module, not just a callable object!
If Operation's behaviour differs from one opset version to another, you should implement it separately.

</details>

<details>
<summary>but has different behaviour</summary>

An example of such a module is [ScatterND](./onnx2torch/node_converters/scatter_nd.py)

```python
# It is recommended to use Enum for string ONNX attributes.
class ReductionOnnxAttr(Enum):
    NONE = "none"
    ADD = "add"
    MUL = "mul"


class OnnxScatterND(nn.Module, OnnxToTorchModuleWithCustomExport):
    def __init__(self, reduction: ReductionOnnxAttr):
        super().__init__()
        self._reduction = reduction

    # The following method should return ONNX attributes with their values as a dictionary.
    # The number of attributes, their names and values depend on opset version;
    # method should return correct set of attributes.
    # Note: add type-postfix for each key: reduction -> reduction_s, where s means "string".
    def _onnx_attrs(self, opset_version: int) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        onnx_attrs: Dict[str, Any] = {}

        # Here we handle opset versions < 16 where there is no "reduction" attribute.
        if opset_version < 16:
            if self._reduction != ReductionOnnxAttr.NONE:
                raise ValueError(
                    "ScatterND from opset < 16 does not support"
                    f"reduction attribute != {ReductionOnnxAttr.NONE.value},"
                    f"got {self._reduction.value}"
                )
            return onnx_attrs

        onnx_attrs["reduction_s"] = self._reduction.value
        return onnx_attrs

    def forward(
        self,
        data: torch.Tensor,
        indices: torch.Tensor,
        updates: torch.Tensor,
    ) -> torch.Tensor:
        def _forward():
            # ScatterND forward implementation...
            return output

        if torch.onnx.is_in_onnx_export():
            # Please follow our convention, args consists of:
            # forward function, operation type, operation inputs, operation attributes.
            onnx_attrs = self._onnx_attrs(opset_version=get_onnx_version())
            return DefaultExportToOnnx.export(
                _forward, "ScatterND", data, indices, updates, onnx_attrs
            )

def _(node: OnnxNode, graph: OnnxGraph) -> OperationConverterResult:
    node_attributes = node.attributes
    reduction = ReductionOnnxAttr(node_attributes.get("reduction", "none"))
    return OperationConverterResult(
        torch_module=OnnxScatterND(reduction=reduction),
        onnx_mapping=onnx_mapping_from_node(node=node),
    )
```

Here we have used a trick to convert the model from torch back to ONNX by defining the custom `_ScatterNDExportToOnnx`.

## Opset version workaround

Incase you are using a model with older opset, try the following workaround:

[ONNX Version Conversion - Official Docs](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/main/docs/PythonAPIOverview.md#converting-version-of-an-onnx-model-within-default-domain-aionnx)

<details>
<summary>Example</summary>

```python
import onnx
from onnx import version_converter
import torch
from onnx2torch import convert

# Load the ONNX model.
model = onnx.load("model.onnx")
# Convert the model to the target version.
target_version = 13
converted_model = version_converter.convert_version(model, target_version)
# Convert to torch.
torch_model = convert(converted_model)
torch.save(torch_model, "model.pt")
```

</details>

Note: use this only when the model does not convert to PyTorch using the existing opset version. Result might vary.
