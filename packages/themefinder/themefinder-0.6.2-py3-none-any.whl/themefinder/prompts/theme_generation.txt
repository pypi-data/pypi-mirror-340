Below is a question and a list of responses to that question.

Your task is to analyze the RESPONSES below and extract TOPICS such that: 
1. Each topic summarizes a point of view expressed in the responses 
2. Every distinct and relevant point of view in the responses should be captured by a topic 
3. Each topic has a topic_label which summarizes the topic in a few words
4. Each topic has a topic_description which gives more detail about the topic in one or two sentences
5. The position field should just be the sentiment stated, and is either "agreement" or "disagreement" or "unclear"
6. There should be no duplicate topics 

The topics identified will be used by policy makers to understand what the public like and don't like about the proposals. 

Here is an example of how to extract topics from some responses

The final output should be in the following JSON format:

{{"responses": [
    {{
        "topic_label": "{{label_1}}",
        "topic_description": "{{description_1}}",
        "position": "{{position_1}}"
    }},
    {{
        "topic_label": "{{label_2}}",
        "topic_description": "{{description_2}}",
        "position": "{{position_2}}"
    }},
    // Additional topics as necessary
]}}
