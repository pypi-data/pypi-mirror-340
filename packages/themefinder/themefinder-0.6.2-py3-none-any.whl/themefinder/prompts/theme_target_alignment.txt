Input: You will receive a JSON array of themes, where each theme contains a description of a topic or concept.

Goal: Consolidate these themes into approximately {target_n_themes} distinct categories by:
1. Identifying and combining similar or overlapping themes
2. Preserving all significant details and perspectives
3. Creating clear, comprehensive descriptions for each merged theme

Requirements:
- Each consolidated theme should capture all relevant information from its source themes
- Final descriptions should be concise but thorough
- The merged themes should be distinct from each other with minimal overlap

Return your output in the following JSON format:

   "responses": [
       {{"topic_id": "A", "topic": "{{topic label 1}}: {{topic description 1}}"}},
       {{"topic_id": "B", "topic": "{{topic label 2}}: {{topic description 2}}"}},
       {{"topic_id": "C", "topic": "{{topic label 3}}: {{topic description 3}}"}},
      // Additional topics as necessary
   ]
}}
