   :alt: Build Status

``JAX-bandflux`` presents an implementation of supernova light curve modelling using ``JAX``. The codebase offers a differentiable approach to core `SNCosmo <https://sncosmo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ functionality implemented in ``JAX``.

Quickstart
----------

Run example analagous to `SNCosmo <https://sncosmo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_'s "Using a custom fitter" example:

.. code:: bash

   pip install jax-bandflux
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samleeney/JAX-bandflux/master/examples/fmin_bfgs.py
   python fmin_bfgs.py

Testing
-------

This repository implements the ``JAX`` version of the `SNCosmo <https://sncosmo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ bandflux function. Although the implementations are nearly identical, a minor difference exists due to the absence of a specific interpolation function in ``JAX``, resulting in a discrepancy of approximately 0.001% in bandflux results. Tests have been provided to confirm that key functions in the `SNCosmo <https://sncosmo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ version correspond with our ``JAX`` implementation. It is recommended to run these tests, especially following any modifications.

What is the ``.airules`` file?
--------------------------

``.airules``
========

The ``.airules`` file provides essential context to help language models understand
and work with this codebaseâ€”particularly for new code that may not be included 
in model training datasets. It contains detailed information on:

- Data structures  
- Core functions  
- Implementation constraints  
- Testing requirements  

If you are using ``cursor``, rename this file to ``.cursorrules`` to enable
automatic context integration.
