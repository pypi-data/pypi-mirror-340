Jupyter Notebook Examples
=========================

These example notebooks demonstrate some basic ``large-image`` functionality used in Jupyter_ Notebooks.

You can view static versions of these example notebooks here (these do not include dynamic image viewers):

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   ./notebooks/large_image_examples.ipynb
   ./notebooks/zarr_sink_example.ipynb


To see the dynamic image viewers, you can run these example notebooks in any Jupyter environment.
To download any of these example notebooks, visit the notebooks_ folder in our Github repository.
Or, you can run any of these notebooks in Google Colab with the following links:

- Using Large Image in Jupyter: `Run large_image_examples.ipynb in Colab <examples_>`_
- Using the Zarr Tile Sink: `Run zarr_sink_example.ipynb in Colab <zarr_sink_>`_
