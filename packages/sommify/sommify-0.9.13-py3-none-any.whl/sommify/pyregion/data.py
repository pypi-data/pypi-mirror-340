            "julie": "Chiles’ vineyards run for about 1300km, north to South, along the Pacific Ocean coastal area and most major regions of production are located to the South of the capital city, Santiago. From north to south, the six regional Denominations of Origin (DOs) in Chile are Atacama, Coquimbo, Aconcagua, the Valle Central (Central Valley), Sur (the Southern Regions), and a new area at the southernmost limit of grape growing in the country, the Austral Region. The northernmost regions of Atacama and Coquimbo are dry and desert-like, with grapes historically destined for Pisco production or the table. The country’s most suitable vineyards for fine wine are mostly situated in the Central Valley to the south of Santiago, where the proximity of the Andes cools night-time temperatures, and along the coast, where the cold, maritime Humboldt Current cools the vines.

The region’s craggy mountains act as barriers to the humid Atlantic winds, and the Douro becomes progressively drier and hotter toward the Spanish border. There are three subzones in Douro; Baixo Corgo to the west has the highest density of plantings, Cima Corgo has the highest total vineyard acreage, and Douro Superior, which stretches to the Spanish border, is the largest, most arid, and most sparsely planted region in Douro. The region is famous for the production of fortified wines known as Port wines that represent about 50% of the total production.

Viura, also called Macabeo, is the principal white grape for the production of white Rioja. Rioja wines are be labelled as Joven, Crianza, Reserva and Gran Reserva depending on their time of ageing in cask and bottle before release. A small amount of Rioja is also produced as rosé wine and since 2018, the region is also allowed to produce some sparkling wines sold as “vino espumoso de Calidad”. ",
