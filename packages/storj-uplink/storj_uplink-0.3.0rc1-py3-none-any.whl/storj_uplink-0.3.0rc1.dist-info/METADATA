# storj-uplink

> A python library for interacting with the [Storj][storj] network

This project is based on the [`uplink-python` repository][uplink-python]. Some key differences are:

1. This package uses the latest version of [uplink-c] rather than be locked to version 1.2.2
1. The binaries will be prebuilt and included with the distribution
   - This means that any downstream consumer won't have to have go and gcc installed

This is still in the early stages and under active development.

## Note

This project has been set up using PyScaffold 4.6. For details and usage
information on PyScaffold see https://pyscaffold.org/.
