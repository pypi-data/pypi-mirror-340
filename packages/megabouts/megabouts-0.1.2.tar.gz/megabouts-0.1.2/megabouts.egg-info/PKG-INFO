## Overview

Megabouts is a Python toolbox designed to quantify zebrafish larval locomotion. It supports in both freely swimming and head-restrained conditions, adapting to various experimental setups and recording framerate.

**📚 Full documentation and tutorials available at: [megabouts.ai](https://megabouts.ai)**

## Features

- **Flexible Data Input**:
  - Multiple tracking methods (full tracking, head tracking, tail tracking)
  - Support various frame rates (20-700 Hz) and resolutions
  - Compatible with different tracking software (e.g., SLEAP)

- **Analysis Pipeline**:
  - Tail angle and trajectory preprocessing
  - Tail bout detection
  - Movement classification using transformer neural networks
  - Sparse coding for head-restrained experiments

## Installation

```bash
pip install megabouts
```

## Quick Start

```python
from megabouts.tracking_data import TrackingConfig, FullTrackingData, load_example_data
from megabouts.pipeline import FullTrackingPipeline

# Load example data
df_recording, fps, mm_per_unit = load_example_data("fulltracking_posture")

# Configure tracking
tracking_cfg = TrackingConfig(fps=fps, tracking="full_tracking")

# Create tracking data
head_x = df_recording["head_x"].values * mm_per_unit
head_y = df_recording["head_y"].values * mm_per_unit
head_yaw = df_recording["head_angle"].values
tail_angle = df_recording.filter(like="tail_angle").values

tracking_data = FullTrackingData.from_posture(
    head_x=head_x, 
    head_y=head_y, 
    head_yaw=head_yaw, 
    tail_angle=tail_angle
)

# Create pipeline and run
pipeline = FullTrackingPipeline(tracking_cfg)
tracking, tail, traj, segments, bouts, ethogram = pipeline.run(tracking_data)
```
