# This program is an implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path in a graph.
# The graph is represented as a dictionary, and the program uses NetworkX for visualisation.
# A graph is a collection of nodes that are connected by edges.
# Each edge has a weight, which represents the cost of traversing that edge.
# A graph can be oriented which means that an edge can go from A to B but not necessary from B to A.
# It can also be undirected which means that all edges go in both directions.
# Here, to simplify the implementation of the algorithm, the graph is undirected
# The following class is used to initialize the graph. You can then run functions on it to add nodes and edges, and to find the shortest path between two nodes.
# You can also visualize the graph and the shortest path between two nodes.
