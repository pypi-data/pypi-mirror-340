    "## Relational database to 3D geospatial database\n",
    "\n",
    "A geospatial database is a relational database that can also store geospatial data. There are two broad categories of geospatial data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Raster data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIS_file_format#Raster_formats): geographic information as a grid of pixels (cells), where each pixel stores a value corresponding to a specific location and attribute, such as elevation, temperature, or land cover. So, a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) is an example of GIS raster data.\n",
    "2. [Vector data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIS_file_format#Vector_formats): tables in which each row contains:\n",
    "    - [Simple feature GIS geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Features), represented as [Well-Known Text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text_representation_of_geometry). For example in the `InSitu_GEOL` and `InSitu_ISPT` tables:\n",
    "        `InSitu_GEOL`: a depth interval in a borehole where sand was found.\n",
    "        `InSitu_ISPT`: a point in a borehole where an SPT test was performed.\n",
    "    - Attributes that describe the GIS geometry. For example in the `InSitu_GEOL` and `InSitu_ISPT` tables:\n",
    "        `InSitu_GEOL`: the geology code (`GEOL_GEOL`), general description of stratum (`GEOL_DESC`), etc.\n",
    "        `InSitu_ISPT`: the SPT N-value (`ISPT_NVAL`), energy ratio of the hammer (`ISPT_ERAT`), etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, when representing GI data as 3D GIS features, we are talking about GIS vector data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### From GI dataframe to `geopandas.GeoDataFrame`\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to construct the 3D simple feature GIS geometry of the `Location`s, `Sample`s and `InSitu_TEST`s, a few more columns have to be calcualated for each of these tables: `elevation_at_top` and `elevation_at_base` if the in-situ test or sample was taken over a depth interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 3D simple feature GIS geometry as [WKT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text_representation_of_geometry) for point tests and samples:\n",
    "`POINT (easting northing elevation_at_top)`\n",
    "\n",
    "The 3D simple feature GIS geometry as WKT for in-situ tests and samples taken over a depth interval:\n",
    "`LINESTRING (easting northing elevation_at_top, easting northing elevation_at_base)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, a `LonLatHeight` table is created which contains the GI locations at ground level in WGS84 - World Geodetic System 1984 - EPSG:4326 coordinates (Longitude, Latitude, Ellipsoidal Height), which in WKT looks like:\n",
    "`POINT (longitude latitude wgs84_ground_level_height)`\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for creating the `LonLatHeight` table is that vertical lines in projected Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS) are often not rendered nicely by default in all web-mapping software. Vertical lines are often not visible when looking at a map from above, and not all web-mapping software is capable of handling geometry in non-WGS84, i.e. (Lon, Lat) coordinates.\n",

    "Bluntly put, Shapefile is a bad format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among other problems, Shapefile isn't just a single file. One has to at least share three files [(*.shp, *.dbf, *.shx)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile#Mandatory_files), which doesn't include the definition of a CRS. In case that doesn't sound terrible enough to you yet, please have a look at the fantastic website [switchfromshapefile.org](http://switchfromshapefile.org/).\n",

    "\n",
    "GeoJSON is a nice, human readable file format for GIS vector data, which is especially useful for web services, but has a few drawbacks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Although it is technically possible to use GeoJSON with more CRSs, the [specification states clearly](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946#section-4) that WGS84 with EPSG:4326 and coordinates (Lon, Lat, Height) is the only CRS that should be used in GeoJSON (see [switchfromshapefile.org](http://switchfromshapefile.org/#geojson)).\n",
    "- GeoJSON support in ArcGIS isn't fantastic. You have to go through [Geoprocessing - JSON to Features conversion tool](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/tool-reference/conversion/json-to-features.htm) to add a GeoJSON to your ArcGIS project, which is a bit cumbersome."
