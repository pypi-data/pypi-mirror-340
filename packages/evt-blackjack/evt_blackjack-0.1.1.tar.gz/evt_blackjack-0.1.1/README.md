After installing, you might see this warning:

    WARNING: The script bj.exe is installed in '...Scripts', which is not on PATH.

That just means Windows doesn't know where to find the bj command yet.
You have 2 easy options:

✅ Option 1: Use the fallback command

    python -m bj

🛠 Option 2: Add Scripts to your PATH manually

    C:\Users\your-name\AppData\Local\Packages\PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.11_xxx\LocalCache\local-                        packages\Python311\Scripts

Add it to your system PATH:

Open Start → “Environment Variables”

Edit the Path variable

Add a new entry for the folder path

Click OK and restart your terminal

Then you can run:
                bj
