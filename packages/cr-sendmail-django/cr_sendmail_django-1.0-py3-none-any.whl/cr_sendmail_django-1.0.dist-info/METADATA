# cr-sendmail-django

Django email backend which invokes system `sendmail` binary.


## Usage

In your Django settings, set the email backend:

```python
EMAIL_BACKEND = "cr_sendmail.backends.SendmailBackend"
```

You can also specify a path to the `sendmail` binary:

```python
SENDMAIL_BINARY = "/path/to/sendmail"
```

NOTE: this package does not send mail on its own. It requires a fully configured Mail Transport Agent (MTA) on your server. Only use this package if you have configured an MTA such as `exim`, `postfix`, etc. on your server. CodeRed Cloud hosting *does* provide a fully functional MTA with paid plans; however other providers such as AWS, Azure, Digital Ocean, Heroku, etc. do not by default.

## Logging

This package uses Python logging to logger named `cr-sendmail-django`. To see log output, configure [Django logging](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/howto/logging/).


## Compatibility with `django_sendmail_backend`

This package also provides a compatible `django_sendmail_backend` package, as a drop-in replacement for existing sites without modification.

```python
EMAIL_BACKEND = "django_sendmail_backend.backends.EmailBackend"
```

## Credits

This package is a replacement for `django_sendmail_backend`, supported by CodeRed.
