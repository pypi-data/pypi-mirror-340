# Connor's Lightning Parser Lib (LPL)

Connor's Lightning Parser Lib (LPL) is an extremely powerful analysis utility with a simplistic front-end in mind.

The analyzer is capable of processing millions of LYLOUT datapoints in mere minutes by using a SQL database back-end for initial filtering, and then uses optimized work-arounds for computationally expensive methods that omit square-root and trig functions for distances between points. Not to mention it's back-end parses most data with indexes (list[int], list[list[int]], etc.) instead of the entire data itself. Additionally, it uses multi-processing when necessary to accelerate processes.

>[!NOTE]
>The stitchings are done on a temporal and delta-magnitude basis. This basically means that scipy's cKDTree, despite being powerful and timely, does not include temporal thresholds and therefore would not accurately stitch lightning points that respect the lightning strike. Therefore, this code will go from 4 minutes with 3 million points to 2 hours for 10 million points. I will likely switch to C or C++ down the line to improve processing time. But for now, this is the most optimized Python library I can make for temporal distance lightning stitching.

All of these methods allow extremely fast computation times, given the immense scale and size of the data itself.

>[!NOTE]
> The gray, un-stitched dots in the figure are points that do not meet the criteria to be a part of the lightning strike, as determined by stitching parameters. By comparing stitched vs. non-stitched points in the visualization, you can verify the validity of the strike stitching algorithm

![most_pts_xlma](https://github.com/CorniiDog/lightning_parser_lib/raw/main/.img/most_pts_xlma.gif)

This library extracts LYLOUT data, store it into a lightning database, and processes millions of datapoints in the database to a reasonably fast and optimized speed. This project is meant to be a framework for applications to implement and parse data more appropriately.

Assuming the following specs (tested on a laptop with Ubuntu 22.04):
 - 64 GB DDR4 RAM
 - RTX 2060 Mobile (6GB)
 - Intel i7-10750H (6 Cores -> 12 Threads)
 - Python 3.12.3 (Regular version/Not conda)


Three million datapoints should take roughly 4 minutes to process (excluding generating plots). Running the same exact parameters again would take 18-20 seconds due to caching.

## Start

### Getting Started

1. Install project in your environment: `pip install lightning-parser-lib`

2. Create a `main.py` and paste the boilerplate sample code:
```py
####################################################################################
#
# About: A top-down view of what is going on
#
####################################################################################
"""
This program processes LYLOUT data files, such as "LYLOUT_20220712_pol.exported.dat"

1. It first reads through all the files, and then puts all of the points into an 
SQLite database

2. Then, with user-specified filters, the user extracts a pandas DataFrame 
(DataFrame "events") from the SQLite database that meets all of the 
filter criteria. 

3. Afterwards, with user-specified parameters, the lightning_bucketer processes 
all of the "events" data to return a list of lightning strikes, which each 
lightning strike is simply a list of indices for the "events" DataFrame
(a list of lists).

4. You can use the events with the lightning strikes data to plot data or analyze 
the data. Examples in the code and comments below show how to do so.

3. Run in terminal: `python main.py`

4. Drag and drop your LYLOUT text files into `lylout_files` directory.

![lylout](https://github.com/CorniiDog/lightning_research_application/raw/main/.img/lylout_files.png)

> [!NOTE]
> Some individuals may upload a compressed LYLOUT file without adding a suggestive extension filename. Make sure that all LYLOUT files are able to be readable as a text file. If they are not, they are likely compressed, with or without the extension name. It is suggested to try to add the ".gz" extension at the end manually by renaming the file, and attempt to unzip it. If that is not successful, try adding ".zip" and attempt to unzip.
>
>![gz_example](https://github.com/CorniiDog/lightning_research_application/raw/main/.img/gz_example.png)

> [!NOTE]
> When data is added to "lylout_files", everything gets hashed and recorded into "lylout_db.db". This ".db" file is a SQL database that stores all historical lightning strikes. If the database is becoming too large, you can simply delete the "lylout_db.db" file.

5. Modify the filters in "main.py":
```py
start_time = datetime.datetime(2020, 4, 29, 0, 0, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc).timestamp()  # Timestamp converts to unix (float)
end_time = datetime.datetime(2020, 4, 29, 23, 59, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc).timestamp()  # Timestamp converts to unix (float)


# Build filter list for time_unix boundaries.
# Look at "List of headers" above for additional
# Filterings
filters = [
        ("time_unix", ">=", start_time),  # In unix
        ("time_unix", "<=", end_time),  # In unix
        ("reduced_chi2", "<", 5.0,),  # The chi^2 (reliability index) value to accept the data
        ("num_stations", ">=", 5),  # Number of stations that have visibly seen the strike
        ("alt", "<=", 24000),  # alt is in meters. Therefore 20 km = 20000m
        ("alt", ">", 0),  # Above ground
        ("power_db", ">", -4),  # In dBW
        ("power_db", "<", 50),  # In dBW
    ]
```

6. Modify parameters
```py
# Additional parameters that determines "What points make up a single lightning strike"
# They are explicitly defined
params = {
        # Creating an initial lightning strike
        "max_lightning_dist": 30000,  # Max distance between two points to determine it being involved in the same strike
        "max_lightning_speed": 1.4e8,  # Max speed between two points in m/s (essentially dx/dt)
        "min_lightning_speed": 0,  # Min speed between two points in m/s (essentially dx/dt)
        "min_lightning_points": 100,  # The minimum number of points to pass the system as a "lightning strike"
        "max_lightning_time_threshold": 0.3,  # Max number of seconds between points 
        "max_lightning_duration": 30, # Max seconds that define an entire lightning strike. This is essentially a "time window" for all of the points to fill the region that determines a "lightning strike"

        # Combining intercepting lightning strike data filtering
        "combine_strikes_with_intercepting_times": True, # Set to true to ensure that strikes with intercepting times get combined. 
        "intercepting_times_extension_buffer": 0.6, # Number of seconds of additional overlap to allow an additional strike to be involved
        "intercepting_times_extension_max_distance": 100000, # The max distance between the start point of one lightning strike and at least one from the entirety of another lightning strike's points

        # Caching
        "cache_results": True, # Set to true to cache results
        "max_cache_life_days": 7 # The number of days to save a cache
    }

```

7. Run with `python main.py` again and observe the images in their respective directories

## Off-Shoring Processes


The lightning-parser-lib comes with bindings that allow offshore processing of the
`config_and_parser` class to another computer that is more powerful.

![client_server](https://github.com/CorniiDog/lightning_parser_lib/raw/main/.img/client-server-color-icon.png)

These bindings are powered by my [remote-events package here](https://pypi.org/project/remote-events/) that automates function calls to another computer

### `server.py`

```py

def main():
    """
    Main function to configure the lightning system, initialize the queue and remote functions,
    register various tasks, start the processing system, and launch the remote functions server.
    """

    # This, at the top of the main function,
    # Allows binding all console outputs to output.txt
    # i.e. if the server has a 'print' statement, it will send it to 'output.txt'
    # The output.txt file will be automatically read by the config and parser
    remote_functions.run_self_with_output_filename("output.txt")
